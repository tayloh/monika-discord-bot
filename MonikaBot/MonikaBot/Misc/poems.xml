  <Story nr="0" title="I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings"> 

The free bird leaps
on the back of the wind
and floats downstream
till the current ends
and dips his wings
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky.

But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings
with fearful trill
of the things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill for the caged bird
sings of freedom

The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
and he names the sky his own.

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

    <Story nr="1" title="Invictus: The Unconquerable"> 

Out of the night that covers me,
      Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
      For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
      Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
      How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
      I am the captain of my soul.This oft anthologised, oft quoted, oft hated poem is
 sometimes published with the first line as title and so it is listed here in that fashion.
It is also sometimes known as I. T. R M. Hamilton Bruce since, after Bruce's death, Henley had those words added to subsequent publications of this poem.
 'Invicitus' is sweeping; passionate; larger than life in a way that few modern poems can get away with. It is also an oft quoted poem, lines of it having almost passed into the language. While these are invariably the ones that involve hurling defiance into the teeth of the storm, note that the  poem itself hinges just as strongly on the 'storm' itself. It is the tension  between the strongly contrastive elements that raises 'Invicitus' from a series of platitudes to a great poem.

    <Story nr="2" title="The Road Not Taken"> 


	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	And looked down one as far as I could
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
	Then took the other, as just as fair,
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	Though as for that the passing there
	Had worn them really about the same,
	And both that morning equally lay
	In leaves no step had trodden black.
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
	I doubted if I should ever come back.
	I shall be telling this with a sigh
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
	    I took the one less traveled by,
	    And that has made all the difference.

    <Story nr="3" title="All The World's A Stage"> 


	All the world's a stage,
	And all the men and women merely players;
	They have their exits and their entrances,
	And one man in his time plays many parts,
	His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
	Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
	Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
	That ends this strange eventful history,
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

    <Story nr="4" title="If You Forget Me"> 

I want you to know
one thing. 

You know how this is: 
if I look 
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
of the slow autumn at my window, 
if I touch 
near the fire 
the impalpable ash 
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
everything carries me to you, 
as if everything that exists, 
aromas, light, metals, 
were little boats 
that sail 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 

Well, now, 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I shall stop loving you little by little. 

If suddenly 
you forget me 
do not look for me, 
for I shall already have forgotten you. 

If you think it long and mad, 
the wind of banners 
that passes through my life, 
and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots, 
remember 
that on that day, 
at that hour, 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land. 

But 
if each day, 
each hour, 
you feel that you are destined for me 
with implacable sweetness, 
if each day a flower 
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
ah my love, ah my own, 
in me all that fire is repeated, 
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine.

    <Story nr="5" title="Phenomenal Woman"> 


	Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
	I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
	But when I start to tell them,
	They think I'm telling lies.
	I say,
	It's in the reach of my arms
	The span of my hips,
	The stride of my step,
	The curl of my lips.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.
	I walk into a room
	Just as cool as you please,
	And to a man,
	The fellows stand or
	Fall down on their knees.
	Then they swarm around me,
	A hive of honey bees.
	I say,
	It's the fire in my eyes,
	And the flash of my teeth,
	The swing in my waist,
	And the joy in my feet.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.
	Men themselves have wondered
	What they see in me.
	They try so much
	But they can't touch
	My inner mystery.
	When I try to show them
	They say they still can't see.
	I say,
	It's in the arch of my back,
	The sun of my smile,
	The ride of my breasts,
	The grace of my style.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.
	Now you understand
	Just why my head's not bowed.
	I don't shout or jump about
	Or have to talk real loud.
	When you see me passing
	It ought to make you proud.
	I say,
	It's in the click of my heels,
	The bend of my hair,
	the palm of my hand,
	The need of my care,
	'Cause I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.

    <Story nr="9" title="Annabel Lee"> 

It was many and many a year ago,
          In a kingdom by the sea,
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know
          By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
    And this maiden she lived with no other thought
          Than to love and be loved by me.

    I was a child and she was a child,
          In this kingdom by the sea;
    But we loved with a love that was more than love-
          I and my Annabel Lee;
    With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
          Coveted her and me.

    And this was the reason that, long ago,
          In this kingdom by the sea,
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
          My beautiful Annabel Lee;
    So that her highborn kinsman came
          And bore her away from me,
    To shut her up in a sepulchre
          In this kingdom by the sea.

    The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
          Went envying her and me-
    Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know,
          In this kingdom by the sea)
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

    But our love it was stronger by far than the love
          Of those who were older than we-
          Of many far wiser than we-
    And neither the angels in heaven above,
          Nor the demons down under the sea,
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
    And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
    And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
    Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,
          In the sepulchre there by the sea,
          In her tomb by the sounding sea.

    <Story nr="10" title="Daffodils"> 

I wandered lonely as a cloud
  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
  A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
  And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
  Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
  Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
  In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
  In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
  Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils.The picture is of daffodils at Ullswater. In 1802  William and Dorothy Wordsworth's visited  Glencoyne Park. On 15th April 1802, they passed the strip of land at Glencoyne Bay, called Ullswater.
It is this visit that gave Wordsworth the inspiration to write this famous poem. 

*Excerpt from Dorothy's journal:

'When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few daffodils close to the water side. We fancied that the lake had floated the seed ashore and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and more and at last under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. 
I never saw daffodils so beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about and about them, some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake, they looked so gay ever dancing ever changing. 

This wind blew directly over the lake to them. There was here and there a little knot and a few stragglers a few yards higher up but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity and unity and life of that one busy highway. We rested again and again. The Bays were stormy, and we heard the waves at different distances and in the middle of the water like the sea'. 

Dorothy Wordsworth, The Grasmere Journal - Thursday 15 April 1802.

	If you can keep your head when all about you

	  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,

	  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
	If you can dream — and not make dreams your master;
	  If you can think — and not make thoughts your aim,
	If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
	  And treat those two impostors just the same:.
	If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
	  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
	Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
	  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;
	If you can make one heap of all your winnings
	  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
	And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
	  And never breathe a word about your loss:

    <Story nr="12" title="Still I Rise"> 

You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

    <Story nr="16" title="Television"> 


	The most important thing we've learned,
	So far as children are concerned,
	Is never, NEVER, NEVER let
	Them near your television set --
	Or better still, just don't install
	The idiotic thing at all.
	In almost every house we've been,
	We've watched them gaping at the screen.
	They loll and slop and lounge about,
	And stare until their eyes pop out.
	(Last week in someone's place we saw
	A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)
	They sit and stare and stare and sit
	Until they're hypnotised by it,
	Until they're absolutely drunk
	With all that shocking ghastly junk.
	Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,
	They don't climb out the window sill,
	They never fight or kick or punch,
	They leave you free to cook the lunch
	And wash the dishes in the sink --
	But did you ever stop to think,
	To wonder just exactly what
	This does to your beloved tot?
	IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!
	IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!
	IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!
	IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND
	HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND
	A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!
	HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!
	HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!
	HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!
	'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say,
	'But if we take the set away,
	What shall we do to entertain
	Our darling children? Please explain!'
	We'll answer this by asking you,
	'What used the darling ones to do?
	'How used they keep themselves contented
	Before this monster was invented?'
	Have you forgotten? Don't you know?
	We'll say it very loud and slow:
	THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,
	AND READ and READ, and then proceed
	To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!
	One half their lives was reading books!
	The nursery shelves held books galore!
	Books cluttered up the nursery floor!
	And in the bedroom, by the bed,
	More books were waiting to be read!
	Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales
	Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales
	And treasure isles, and distant shores
	Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,
	And pirates wearing purple pants,
	And sailing ships and elephants,
	And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,
	Stirring away at something hot.
	(It smells so good, what can it be?
	Good gracious, it's Penelope.)
	The younger ones had Beatrix Potter
	With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,
	And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,
	And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-
	Just How The Camel Got His Hump,
	And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,
	And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,
	There's Mr. Rate and Mr. Mole-
	Oh, books, what books they used to know,
	Those children living long ago!
	So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,
	Go throw your TV set away,
	And in its place you can install
	A lovely bookshelf on the wall.
	Then fill the shelves with lots of books,
	Ignoring all the dirty looks,
	The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,
	And children hitting you with sticks-
	Fear not, because we promise you
	That, in about a week or two
	Of having nothing else to do,
	They'll now begin to feel the need
	Of having something to read.
	And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy!
	You watch the slowly growing joy
	That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen
	They'll wonder what they'd ever seen
	In that ridiculous machine,
	That nauseating, foul, unclean,
	Repulsive television screen!
	And later, each and every kid
	Will love you more for what you did.

Between me and my dream.
Rose until it touched the sky—

Shadow.

No longer the light of my dream before me,

From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

	Do not go gentle into that good night.
	Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
	Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
	Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
	Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
	And learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,
	Do not go gentle into that good night.
	Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
	Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

    <Story nr="23" title="A Lover's Call   XXVII"> 

Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little 
Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you 
As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? 


Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of 
Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon 
Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? 


Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, 
While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? 


Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you 
Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the 
Field, haven of your dreams? 


Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the 
Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and 
Filling their hands with your bounty? 


You are God's spirit everywhere; 
You are stronger than the ages. 


Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of 
You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love 
Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? 


Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the 
Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs 
Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? 


Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands 
Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if 
We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? 


Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, 
And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? 
That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love 
Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! 


That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, 
Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. 


That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, 
Announcing the glory of my soul; and there 
It shall perpetuate until again we meet. 


I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, 
With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, 
"Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, 
And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. 


"But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of 
Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God. 


"Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; 
Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower 
The cup of the sweetness of life. 
As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my 
Comforting groom; your memory, my Eternal wedding." 


Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in 
The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey 
To you my heart's every beat and affection. 


Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image 
Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his 
Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. 


Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty 
And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. 


Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping 
From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? 
Do you know the greatness of my patience? 


Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying 
To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any 
Secret communication between angels that will carry to 
You my complaint? 


Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life 
Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. 


Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! 
Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! 


Where are you, me beloved? 
Oh, how great is Love! 
And how little am I!

	I was angry with my friend:

	And I watered it in fears,

	And with soft deceitful wiles.
	And it grew both day and night,
	Till it bore an apple bright.
	And my foe beheld it shine.

    <Story nr="25" title="The Highwayman"> 


	PART ONE
	The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
	The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
	The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
	And the highwayman came riding—
	Riding—riding—
	The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.
	He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
	A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;
	They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!
	And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
	His pistol butts a-twinkle,
	His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.
	Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,
	And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;
	He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
	But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.
	And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked
	Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;
	His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,
	But he loved the landlord's daughter,
	The landlord's red-lipped daughter,
	Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say
	"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,
	But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;
	Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,
	Then look for me by moonlight,
	Watch for me by moonlight,
	I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way."
	He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,
	But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand
	As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;
	And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,
	(Oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)
	Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.
	PART TWO
	He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;
	And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,
	When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,
	A red-coat troop came marching—
	Marching—marching—
	King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.
	They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,
	But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;
	Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!
	There was death at every window;
	And hell at one dark window;
	For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.
	They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;
	They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!
	"Now keep good watch!" and they kissed her.
	She heard the dead man say—Look for me by moonlight;
	Watch for me by moonlight;
	I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!
	She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!
	She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!
	They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,
	Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,
	Cold, on the stroke of midnight,
	The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!
	The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!
	Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,
	She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;
	For the road lay bare in the moonlight;
	Blank and bare in the moonlight;
	And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?
	Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,
	The highwayman came riding,
	Riding, riding!
	The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!
	Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
	Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,
	Then her finger moved in the moonlight,
	Her musket shattered the moonlight,
	Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.
	He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood
	Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!
	Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
	How Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	The landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.
	Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,
	With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!
	Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,
	When they shot him down on the highway,
	Down like a dog on the highway,
	And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,
	When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
	When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
	A highwayman comes riding—
	Riding—riding—
	A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.
	Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;
	He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;
	He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
	But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

'Help, help, ' said a man. 'I'm drowning.'
'Hang on, ' said a man from the shore.
'Help, help, ' said the man. 'I'm not clowning.'
'Yes, I know, I heard you before.
Be patient dear man who is drowning, 
You, see I've got a disease.
I'm waiting for a Doctor J. Browning.
So do be patient please.'
'How long, ' said the man who was drowning. 'Will it take for the Doc to arrive? '
'Not very long, ' said the man with the disease. 'Till then try staying alive.'
'Very well, ' said the man who was drowning. 'I'll try and stay afloat.
By reciting the poems of Browning
And other things he wrote.'
'Help, help, ' said the man with the disease, 'I suddenly feel quite ill.'
'Keep calm.' said the man who was drowning, ' Breathe deeply and lie quite still.'
'Oh dear, ' said the man with the awful disease. 'I think I'm going to die.'
'Farewell, ' said the man who was drowning.
Said the man with the disease, 'goodbye.'
So the man who was drowning, drownded
And the man with the disease past away.

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;

While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:
     But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.


O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;      
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
     Here Captain! dear father!
       This arm beneath your head;
         It is some dream that on the deck,
           You've fallen cold and dead.


My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;      
      Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!
        But I, with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,

	I met a traveler from an antique land
	Who said: two vast and trunkless legs of stone
	Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
	half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
	And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
	The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;
	And on the pedestal these words appear
	"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
	Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"

    <Story nr="34" title="The Pig"> 


	In England once there lived a big
	A wonderfully clever pig.
	To everybody it was plain
	That Piggy had a massive brain.
	He worked out sums inside his head,
	There was no book he hadn't read.
	He knew what made an airplane fly,
	He knew how engines worked and why.
	He knew all this, but in the end
	One question drove him round the bend:
	He simply couldn't puzzle out
	What LIFE was really all about.
	What was the reason for his birth?
	Why was he placed upon this earth?
	His giant brain went round and round.
	Alas, no answer could be found.
	Till suddenly one wondrous night.
	All in a flash he saw the light.
	He jumped up like a ballet dancer
	And yelled, "By gum, I've got the answer!"
	"They want my bacon slice by slice
	"To sell at a tremendous price!
	"They want my tender juicy chops
	"To put in all the butcher's shops!
	"They want my pork to make a roast
	"And that's the part'll cost the most!
	"They want my sausages in strings!
	"They even want my chitterlings!
	"The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
	"That is the reason for my life!"
	Such thoughts as these are not designed
	To give a pig great peace of mind.
	Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
	A pail of pigswill in his hand,
	And piggy with a mighty roar,
	Bashes the farmer to the floor…
	Now comes the rather grizzly bit
	So let's not make too much of it,
	Except that you must understand
	That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
	He ate him up from head to toe,
	Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
	It took an hour to reach the feet,
	Because there was so much to eat,
	And when he finished, Pig, of course,
	Felt absolutely no remorse.
	Slowly he scratched his brainy head
	And with a little smile he said,
	"I had a fairly powerful hunch
	"That he might have me for his lunch.
	"And so, because I feared the worst,
	"I thought I'd better eat him first."

I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
they are small, and the fountain is in France
where you wrote me that last letter and
I answered and never heard from you again.
you used to write insane poems about
ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
knew famous artists and most of them
were your lovers, and I wrote back, it’ all right,
go ahead, enter their lives, I’ not jealous
because we’ never met. we got close once in
New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
is that the famous are worried about
their fame –– not the beautiful young girl in bed
with them, who gives them that, and then awakens
in the morning to write upper case poems about
ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they’ told
us, but listening to you I wasn’ sure. maybe
it was the upper case. you were one of the
best female poets and I told the publishers, 
editors, “ her, print her, she’ mad but she’
magic. there’ no lie in her fire.” I loved you
like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
but that didn’ happen. your letters got sadder.
your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
lovers betray. it didn’ help. you said
you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never
heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
I would probably have been unfair to you or you
to me. it was best like this.

The free bird leaps
on the back of the wind
and floats downstream
till the current ends
and dips his wings
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky.

But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings
with fearful trill
of the things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill for the caged bird
sings of freedom

The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
and he names the sky his own.

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

    <Story nr="38" title="Invictus: The Unconquerable"> 

Out of the night that covers me,
      Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
      For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
      Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
      How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
      I am the captain of my soul.This oft anthologised, oft quoted, oft hated poem is
 sometimes published with the first line as title and so it is listed here in that fashion.
It is also sometimes known as I. T. R M. Hamilton Bruce since, after Bruce's death, Henley had those words added to subsequent publications of this poem.
 'Invicitus' is sweeping; passionate; larger than life in a way that few modern poems can get away with. It is also an oft quoted poem, lines of it having almost passed into the language. While these are invariably the ones that involve hurling defiance into the teeth of the storm, note that the  poem itself hinges just as strongly on the 'storm' itself. It is the tension  between the strongly contrastive elements that raises 'Invicitus' from a series of platitudes to a great poem.

	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	And looked down one as far as I could
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
	Then took the other, as just as fair,
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	Though as for that the passing there
	Had worn them really about the same,
	And both that morning equally lay
	In leaves no step had trodden black.
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
	I doubted if I should ever come back.
	I shall be telling this with a sigh
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
	    I took the one less traveled by,
	    And that has made all the difference.

	All the world's a stage,
	And all the men and women merely players;
	They have their exits and their entrances,
	And one man in his time plays many parts,
	His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
	Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
	Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
	That ends this strange eventful history,
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots, 
remember 
that on that day, 
at that hour, 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land. 

But 
if each day, 
each hour, 
you feel that you are destined for me 
with implacable sweetness, 
if each day a flower 
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
ah my love, ah my own, 
in me all that fire is repeated, 
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine.

	Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
	I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
	But when I start to tell them,
	They think I'm telling lies.
	I say,
	It's in the reach of my arms
	The span of my hips,
	The stride of my step,
	The curl of my lips.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.
	I walk into a room
	Just as cool as you please,
	And to a man,
	The fellows stand or
	Fall down on their knees.
	Then they swarm around me,
	A hive of honey bees.
	I say,
	It's the fire in my eyes,
	And the flash of my teeth,
	The swing in my waist,
	And the joy in my feet.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,

	Men themselves have wondered
	What they see in me.
	They try so much
	But they can't touch
	My inner mystery.
	When I try to show them
	They say they still can't see.
	I say,
	It's in the arch of my back,
	The sun of my smile,
	The ride of my breasts,
	The grace of my style.
	I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.
	Phenomenal woman,
	That's me.
	Now you understand
	Just why my head's not bowed.
	I don't shout or jump about
	Or have to talk real loud.
	When you see me passing
	It ought to make you proud.
	I say,
	It's in the click of my heels,
	The bend of my hair,
	the palm of my hand,
	The need of my care,
	'Cause I'm a woman
	Phenomenally.

    <Story nr="46" title="Annabel Lee"> 

It was many and many a year ago,
          In a kingdom by the sea,
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know
          By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
    And this maiden she lived with no other thought
          Than to love and be loved by me.

    I was a child and she was a child,
          In this kingdom by the sea;
    But we loved with a love that was more than love-
          I and my Annabel Lee;
    With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
          Coveted her and me.

    And this was the reason that, long ago,
          In this kingdom by the sea,
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
          My beautiful Annabel Lee;
    So that her highborn kinsman came
          And bore her away from me,
    To shut her up in a sepulchre
          In this kingdom by the sea.

    The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
          Went envying her and me-
    Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know,
          In this kingdom by the sea)
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

    But our love it was stronger by far than the love
          Of those who were older than we-
          Of many far wiser than we-
    And neither the angels in heaven above,
          Nor the demons down under the sea,
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
    And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
    And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
    Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,
          In the sepulchre there by the sea,
          In her tomb by the sounding sea.

    <Story nr="47" title="Daffodils"> 

I wandered lonely as a cloud
  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
  A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
  And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
  Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
  Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
  In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
  In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
  Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils.The picture is of daffodils at Ullswater. In 1802  William and Dorothy Wordsworth's visited  Glencoyne Park. On 15th April 1802, they passed the strip of land at Glencoyne Bay, called Ullswater.
It is this visit that gave Wordsworth the inspiration to write this famous poem. 

*Excerpt from Dorothy's journal:

'When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few daffodils close to the water side. We fancied that the lake had floated the seed ashore and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and more and at last under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. 
I never saw daffodils so beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about and about them, some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake, they looked so gay ever dancing ever changing. 

This wind blew directly over the lake to them. There was here and there a little knot and a few stragglers a few yards higher up but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity and unity and life of that one busy highway. We rested again and again. The Bays were stormy, and we heard the waves at different distances and in the middle of the water like the sea'. 

Dorothy Wordsworth, The Grasmere Journal - Thursday 15 April 1802.

You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise

I rise.

And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-

That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

    <Story nr="53" title="Television"> 


	The most important thing we've learned,
	So far as children are concerned,
	Is never, NEVER, NEVER let
	Them near your television set --
	Or better still, just don't install
	The idiotic thing at all.
	In almost every house we've been,
	We've watched them gaping at the screen.
	They loll and slop and lounge about,
	And stare until their eyes pop out.
	(Last week in someone's place we saw
	A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)
	They sit and stare and stare and sit
	Until they're hypnotised by it,
	Until they're absolutely drunk
	With all that shocking ghastly junk.
	Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,
	They don't climb out the window sill,
	They never fight or kick or punch,
	They leave you free to cook the lunch
	And wash the dishes in the sink --
	But did you ever stop to think,
	To wonder just exactly what
	This does to your beloved tot?
	IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!
	IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!
	IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!
	IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND
	HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND
	A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!
	HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!
	HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!
	HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!
	'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say,
	'But if we take the set away,
	What shall we do to entertain
	Our darling children? Please explain!'
	We'll answer this by asking you,
	'What used the darling ones to do?
	'How used they keep themselves contented
	Before this monster was invented?'
	Have you forgotten? Don't you know?
	We'll say it very loud and slow:
	THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,
	AND READ and READ, and then proceed
	To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!
	One half their lives was reading books!
	The nursery shelves held books galore!
	Books cluttered up the nursery floor!
	And in the bedroom, by the bed,
	More books were waiting to be read!
	Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales
	Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales
	And treasure isles, and distant shores
	Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,
	And pirates wearing purple pants,
	And sailing ships and elephants,
	And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,
	Stirring away at something hot.
	(It smells so good, what can it be?
	Good gracious, it's Penelope.)
	The younger ones had Beatrix Potter
	With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,
	And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,
	And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-
	Just How The Camel Got His Hump,
	And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,
	And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,
	There's Mr. Rate and Mr. Mole-
	Oh, books, what books they used to know,
	Those children living long ago!
	So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,
	Go throw your TV set away,
	And in its place you can install
	A lovely bookshelf on the wall.
	Then fill the shelves with lots of books,
	Ignoring all the dirty looks,
	The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,
	And children hitting you with sticks-
	Fear not, because we promise you
	That, in about a week or two
	Of having nothing else to do,
	They'll now begin to feel the need
	Of having something to read.
	And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy!
	You watch the slowly growing joy
	That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen
	They'll wonder what they'd ever seen
	In that ridiculous machine,
	That nauseating, foul, unclean,
	Repulsive television screen!
	And later, each and every kid
	Will love you more for what you did.

And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little 
Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you 
As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? 


Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of 
Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon 
Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? 


Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, 
While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? 


Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you 
Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the 
Field, haven of your dreams? 


Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the 
Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and 
Filling their hands with your bounty? 


You are God's spirit everywhere; 
You are stronger than the ages. 


Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of 
You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love 
Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? 


Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the 
Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs 
Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? 


Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands 
Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if 
We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? 


Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, 
And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? 
That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love 
Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! 


That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, 
Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. 


That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, 
Announcing the glory of my soul; and there 
It shall perpetuate until again we meet. 


I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, 
With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, 
"Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, 
And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. 


"But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of 
Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God. 


"Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; 
Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower 
The cup of the sweetness of life. 
As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my 
Comforting groom; your memory, my Eternal wedding." 


Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in 
The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey 
To you my heart's every beat and affection. 


Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image 
Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his 
Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. 


Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty 
And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. 


Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping 
From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? 
Do you know the greatness of my patience? 


Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying 
To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any 
Secret communication between angels that will carry to 
You my complaint? 


Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life 
Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. 


Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! 
Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! 


Where are you, me beloved? 
Oh, how great is Love! 
And how little am I!

	PART ONE
	The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
	The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
	The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
	And the highwayman came riding—
	Riding—riding—
	The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.
	He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
	A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;
	They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!
	And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
	His pistol butts a-twinkle,
	His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.
	Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,
	And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;
	He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
	But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.
	And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked
	Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;
	His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,
	But he loved the landlord's daughter,
	The landlord's red-lipped daughter,
	Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say
	"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,
	But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;
	Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,
	Then look for me by moonlight,
	Watch for me by moonlight,
	I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way."
	He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,
	But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand
	As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;
	And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,
	(Oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)
	Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.
	PART TWO
	He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;
	And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,
	When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,
	A red-coat troop came marching—
	Marching—marching—
	King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.
	They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,
	But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;
	Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!
	There was death at every window;
	And hell at one dark window;
	For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.
	They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;
	They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!
	"Now keep good watch!" and they kissed her.
	She heard the dead man say—Look for me by moonlight;
	Watch for me by moonlight;
	I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!
	She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!
	She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!
	They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,
	Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,
	Cold, on the stroke of midnight,
	The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!
	The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!
	Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,
	She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;
	For the road lay bare in the moonlight;
	Blank and bare in the moonlight;
	And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?
	Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,
	The highwayman came riding,
	Riding, riding!
	The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!
	Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
	Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,
	Then her finger moved in the moonlight,
	Her musket shattered the moonlight,
	Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.
	He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood
	Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!
	Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
	How Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	The landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.
	Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,
	With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!
	Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,
	When they shot him down on the highway,
	Down like a dog on the highway,
	And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,
	When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
	When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
	A highwayman comes riding—
	Riding—riding—
	A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.
	Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;
	He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;
	He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
	But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
	Bess, the landlord's daughter,
	Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

'Yes, I know, I heard you before.
Be patient dear man who is drowning, 
You, see I've got a disease.
I'm waiting for a Doctor J. Browning.
So do be patient please.'
'How long, ' said the man who was drowning. 'Will it take for the Doc to arrive? '
'Not very long, ' said the man with the disease. 'Till then try staying alive.'
'Very well, ' said the man who was drowning. 'I'll try and stay afloat.
By reciting the poems of Browning
And other things he wrote.'
'Help, help, ' said the man with the disease, 'I suddenly feel quite ill.'
'Keep calm.' said the man who was drowning, ' Breathe deeply and lie quite still.'
'Oh dear, ' said the man with the awful disease. 'I think I'm going to die.'
'Farewell, ' said the man who was drowning.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;      
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
     Here Captain! dear father!
       This arm beneath your head;
         It is some dream that on the deck,
           You've fallen cold and dead.


My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;

	Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
	half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
	And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
	The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;
	And on the pedestal these words appear
	"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

    <Story nr="71" title="The Pig"> 


	In England once there lived a big
	A wonderfully clever pig.
	To everybody it was plain
	That Piggy had a massive brain.
	He worked out sums inside his head,
	There was no book he hadn't read.
	He knew what made an airplane fly,
	He knew how engines worked and why.
	He knew all this, but in the end
	One question drove him round the bend:
	He simply couldn't puzzle out
	What LIFE was really all about.
	What was the reason for his birth?
	Why was he placed upon this earth?
	His giant brain went round and round.
	Alas, no answer could be found.
	Till suddenly one wondrous night.
	All in a flash he saw the light.
	He jumped up like a ballet dancer
	And yelled, "By gum, I've got the answer!"
	"They want my bacon slice by slice
	"To sell at a tremendous price!
	"They want my tender juicy chops
	"To put in all the butcher's shops!
	"They want my pork to make a roast
	"And that's the part'll cost the most!
	"They want my sausages in strings!
	"They even want my chitterlings!
	"The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
	"That is the reason for my life!"
	Such thoughts as these are not designed
	To give a pig great peace of mind.
	Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
	A pail of pigswill in his hand,
	And piggy with a mighty roar,
	Bashes the farmer to the floor…
	Now comes the rather grizzly bit
	So let's not make too much of it,
	Except that you must understand
	That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
	He ate him up from head to toe,
	Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
	It took an hour to reach the feet,
	Because there was so much to eat,
	And when he finished, Pig, of course,
	Felt absolutely no remorse.
	Slowly he scratched his brainy head
	And with a little smile he said,
	"I had a fairly powerful hunch
	"That he might have me for his lunch.
	"And so, because I feared the worst,
	"I thought I'd better eat him first."

I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
they are small, and the fountain is in France
where you wrote me that last letter and
I answered and never heard from you again.
you used to write insane poems about
ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
knew famous artists and most of them
were your lovers, and I wrote back, it’ all right,
go ahead, enter their lives, I’ not jealous
because we’ never met. we got close once in
New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
is that the famous are worried about
their fame –– not the beautiful young girl in bed
with them, who gives them that, and then awakens
in the morning to write upper case poems about
ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they’ told
us, but listening to you I wasn’ sure. maybe
it was the upper case. you were one of the
best female poets and I told the publishers, 
editors, “ her, print her, she’ mad but she’
magic. there’ no lie in her fire.” I loved you
like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
but that didn’ happen. your letters got sadder.
your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
lovers betray. it didn’ help. you said
you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never
heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
I would probably have been unfair to you or you
to me. it was best like this.

I loved you:  yet the love, maybe,
Has not extinguished in my heart; 
But hence may not it trouble thee;
I do not want to make you sad.
I loved you hopelessly and mutely,
Now with shyness, now with jealousy being vexed;
I loved you so sincerely, so fondly, 
Likewise may someone love you next.

Translation by Emil Sharafutdinov:

I loved you; even now I must confess,
Some embers of my love their fire retain;
But do not let it cause you more distress,
I do not want to sadden you again.
Hopeless and tonguetied, yet I loved you dearly
With pangs the jealous and the timid know;
So tenderly I love you, so sincerely,
I pray God grant another love you so.


Another translation:

I loved you once, nor can this heart be quiet;
For it would seem that love still lingers there;
But do not you be further troubled by it;
I would in no wise hurt you, oh, my dear.

I loved you without hope, a mute offender;
What jealous pangs, what shy despairs I knew!
A love as deep as this, as true, as tender,
God grant another may yet offer you. 


Another Translation by Babette Deutsch: 

I loved you; and perhaps I love you still,
The flame, perhaps, is not extinguished; yet
It burns so quietly within my soul,
No longer should you feel distressed by it.

Silently and hopelessly I loved you,
At times too jealous and at times too shy.
God grant you find another who will love you
As tenderly and truthfully as I.



Another translation by  Dr. Daniel Feeback:

I loved you once; perhaps I should exclaim,
My love still lingers deep within my core.
But I do not want to cause you any pain,
So grieve thee not for me a moment more.

Silently and hopelessly I loved you,
Tormented, I was too jealous and too shy.
May God provide another who will love you,
Just as gently and as fervently as I.

Another version is at "A collection of poems by Alexander Pushkin":

I loved you: and, it may be, from my soul
The former love has never gone away,
But let it not recall to you my dole;
I wish not sadden you in any way.

I loved you silently, without hope, fully,
In diffidence, in jealousy, in pain;
I loved you so tenderly and truly,
As let you else be loved by any man.

A favorite for guest translations, here's the original Russian along with a mostly literal translation:

I loved you:  yet the love, maybe,
Has not extinguished in my heart; 
But hence may not it trouble thee;
I do not want to make you sad.
I loved you hopelessly and mutely,
Now with shyness, now with jealousy being vexed;

The original Pushkin's poem:
Я вас любил: любовь еще, быть может,
В душе моей угасла не совсем;
Но пусть она вас больше не тревожит;
Я не хочу печалить вас ничем.
Я вас любил безмолвно, безнадежно,
То робостью, то ревностью томим;
Я вас любил так искренно, так нежно,
Как дай вам бог любимой быть другим.This is the most famous Pushkin's love poem addressed to an unknown lady.

The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster,
Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.
I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three beloved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.
— Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture

the art of losing's not too hard to master

    <Story nr="83" title="A Character"> 

I marvel how Nature could ever find space 
For so many strange contrasts in one human face: 
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom 
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom. 

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain; 
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain 
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease, 
Would be rational peace—a philosopher's ease. 

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds, 
And attention full ten times as much as there needs; 
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy; 
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy. 

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare 
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there, 
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim, 
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name. 

This picture from nature may seem to depart, 
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart; 
And I for five centuries right gladly would be 
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.

	Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
	Weep, and you weep alone.
	For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,
	But has trouble enough of its own.
	Sing, and the hills will answer;
	Sigh, it is lost on the air.
	The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
	But shrink from voicing care.
	Rejoice, and men will seek you;
	Grieve, and they turn and go.
	They want full measure of all your pleasure,
	But they do not need your woe.
	Be glad, and your friends are many;
	Be sad, and you lose them all.
	There are none to decline your nectared wine,
	But alone you must drink life's gall.
	Feast, and your halls are crowded;
	Fast, and the world goes by.
	Succeed and give, and it helps you live,
	But no man can help you die.
	There is room in the halls of pleasure
	For a long and lordly train,
	But one by one we must all file on
	Through the narrow aisles of pain.

	What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?
	    Only the monstrous anger of the guns.
	    Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
	Can patter out their hasty orisons.
	No mockeries for them; no prayers nor bells,
	Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, —
	The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;
	And bugles calling for them from sad shires.
	What candles may be held to speed them all?
	      Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes
	  Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.
	      The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;
	  Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,
	  And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour. 

A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house fill'd with doves &amp; Pigeons
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State.
A Horse misus'd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
Each outcry of the hunted Hare
A fibre from the Brain does tear.
A Skylark wounded in the wing,
A Cherubim does cease to sing.
The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
Does the Rising Sun affright.
Every Wolf's &amp; Lion's howl
Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
The wild deer, wand'ring here &amp; there,
Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
The Bat that flits at close of Eve
Has left the Brain that won't believe.
The Owl that calls upon the Night
Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
He who shall hurt the little Wren
Shall never be belov'd by Men.
He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
He who torments the Chafer's sprite
Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
The Catterpillar on the Leaf
Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
He who shall train the Horse to War
Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
The Beggar's Dog &amp; Widow's Cat,
Feed them &amp; thou wilt grow fat.
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
The poison of the Snake &amp; Newt
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
The poison of the Honey Bee
Is the Artist's Jealousy.
The Prince's Robes &amp; Beggars' Rags
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the Lies you can invent.
It is right it should be so;
Man was made for Joy &amp; Woe;
And when this we rightly know
Thro' the World we safely go.
Joy &amp; Woe are woven fine,
A Clothing for the Soul divine;
Under every grief &amp; pine
Runs a joy with silken twine.
The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
Throughout all these Human Lands
Tools were made, &amp; born were hands,
Every Farmer Understands.
Every Tear from Every Eye
Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
This is caught by Females bright
And return'd to its own delight.
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow &amp; Roar
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
Writes Revenge in realms of death.
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
The Soldier arm'd with Sword &amp; Gun,
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
Shall buy &amp; sell the Miser's lands:
Or, if protected from on high,
Does that whole Nation sell &amp; buy.
He who mocks the Infant's Faith
Shall be mock'd in Age &amp; Death.
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
He who respects the Infant's faith
Triumph's over Hell &amp; Death.
The Child's Toys &amp; the Old Man's Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
The Questioner, who sits so sly,
Shall never know how to Reply.
He who replies to words of Doubt
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
Nought can deform the Human Race
Like the Armour's iron brace.
When Gold &amp; Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
The Emmet's Inch &amp; Eagle's Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
He who Doubts from what he sees
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
If the Sun &amp; Moon should doubt
They'd immediately Go out.
To be in a Passion you Good may do,
But no Good if a Passion is in you.
The Whore &amp; Gambler, by the State
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
Dance before dead England's Hearse.
Every Night &amp; every Morn
Some to Misery are Born.
Every Morn &amp; every Night
Some are Born to sweet Delight.
Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
Some are born to Endless Night.
We are led to Believe a Lie
When we see not Thro' the Eye
Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
God Appears &amp; God is Light
To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
But does a Human Form Display
To those who Dwell in Realms of day.

Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved, and were loved, and now we lieIn Flanders’ Fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders’ Fields.www.firstworldwar.com/poetsandprose/inflandersfields.htmOne of the most asked questions is: why poppies? The answer is simple: poppies only flower in up-rooted  soil.  Their seeds can lie on the ground for years and years, and only when someone roots up the ground, they will sprout.  There was enough rooted up soil on the battlefield of the Western Front; in fact the whole front consisted of churned up soil.  So in May 1915, when McCrae wrote his poem, around him poppies blossomed like no one had ever seen before. A Poem written in reply to John McCrae by Miss Moira Micheal (1915)"We shall Keep the Faith"Oh! You who sleep in Flanders’ fields,Sleep sweet – to rise anew;We caught the torch you threw;And holding high we keptThe faith with those who died.We cherish, too, the Poppy redThat grows on fields where valour led.It seems to signal to the skiesThat blood of heroes never dies,But lends a lustre to the redOf the flower that blooms above the deadIn Flanders’ Fields.And now the torch and poppy redWear in honour of our deadFear not that ye have died for naughtWe’ve learned the lesson that ye taughtIn Flanders’ Fields

    <Story nr="90" title="The Listeners"> 

"Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grass
Of the forest's ferny floor;
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
Above the Traveller's head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
"Is there anybody there?" he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveller's call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
Louder, and lifted his head:—
"Tell them I came, and no one answered,
That I kept my word," he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
When the plunging hoofs were gone.

    <Story nr="91" title="A child said, What is the grass?"> 

A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full
hands;
How could I answer the child?. . . .I do not know what it
is any more than he.

I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
green stuff woven.

Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
may see and remark, and say Whose?

Or I guess the grass is itself a child. . . .the produced babe
of the vegetation.

Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the
same, I receive them the same.

And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;
It may be you are from old people and from women, and
from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,
And here you are the mother's laps.

This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
for nothing.

I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
and women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
taken soon out of their laps.

What do you think has become of the young and old men?
What do you think has become of the women and
children?

They are alive and well somewhere;
The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait
at the end to arrest it,
And ceased the moment life appeared.

All goes onward and outward. . . .and nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
luckier.

When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

The sea is calm to-night.
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits;—on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the AEgean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.

The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.

He loved her and she loved him. 
His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to 
He had no other appetite 
She bit him she gnawed him she sucked 
She wanted him complete inside her 
Safe and sure forever and ever 
Their little cries fluttered into the curtains 

Her eyes wanted nothing to get away 
Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows 
He gripped her hard so that life 
Should not drag her from that moment 
He wanted all future to cease 
He wanted to topple with his arms round her 
Off that moment's brink and into nothing 
Or everlasting or whatever there was 

Her embrace was an immense press 
To print him into her bones 
His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace 
Where the real world would never come 
Her smiles were spider bites 
So he would lie still till she felt hungry 
His words were occupying armies 
Her laughs were an assassin's attempts 
His looks were bullets daggers of revenge 
His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets 
His whispers were whips and jackboots 
Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing 
His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway 
Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks 
And their deep cries crawled over the floors 
Like an animal dragging a great trap 
His promises were the surgeon's gag 
Her promises took the top off his skull 
She would get a brooch made of it 
His vows pulled out all her sinews 
He showed her how to make a love-knot 
Her vows put his eyes in formalin 
At the back of her secret drawer 
Their screams stuck in the wall 

Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves 
Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop 

In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs 
In their dreams their brains took each other hostage 

In the morning they wore each other's face

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold:— 
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the Presence in the room he said
"What writest thou?"—The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered "The names of those who love the Lord."
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still, and said "I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men."

The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

I ne'er was struck before that hour 
With love so sudden and so sweet, 
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower 
And stole my heart away complete. 
My face turned pale as deadly pale. 
My legs refused to walk away, 
And when she looked, what could I ail? 
My life and all seemed turned to clay.

And then my blood rushed to my face 
And took my eyesight quite away, 
The trees and bushes round the place 
Seemed midnight at noonday. 
I could not see a single thing, 
Words from my eyes did start — 
They spoke as chords do from the string, 
And blood burnt round my heart.

Are flowers the winter's choice? 
Is love's bed always snow? 
She seemed to hear my silent voice, 
Not love's appeals to know. 
I never saw so sweet a face 
As that I stood before. 
My heart has left its dwelling-place 
And can return no more

I think awhile of Love, and while I think, 
         Love is to me a world, 
         Sole meat and sweetest drink, 
         And close connecting link 
            Tween heaven and earth. 

I only know it is, not how or why, 
         My greatest happiness; 
         However hard I try, 
         Not if I were to die, 
            Can I explain. 

I fain would ask my friend how it can be, 
         But when the time arrives, 
         Then Love is more lovely 
         Than anything to me, 
            And so I'm dumb. 

For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, 
         But only thinks and does; 
         Though surely out 'twill leak 
         Without the help of Greek, 
            Or any tongue. 

A man may love the truth and practise it, 
         Beauty he may admire, 
         And goodness not omit, 
         As much as may befit 
            To reverence. 

But only when these three together meet, 
         As they always incline, 
         And make one soul the seat, 
         And favorite retreat, 
            Of loveliness; 

When under kindred shape, like loves and hates 
         And a kindred nature, 
         Proclaim us to be mates, 
         Exposed to equal fates 
            Eternally; 

And each may other help, and service do, 
         Drawing Love's bands more tight, 
         Service he ne'er shall rue 
         While one and one make two, 
            And two are one; 

In such case only doth man fully prove 
         Fully as man can do, 
         What power there is in Love 
         His inmost soul to move 
            Resistlessly.

Above they barely touch, but undermined

    <Story nr="107" title="The Cremation of Sam McGee"> 


There are strange things done in the midnight sun
	      By the men who moil for gold;
	  The Arctic trails have their secret tales
	      That would make your blood run cold;
	  The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
	      But the queerest they ever did see
	  Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
	      I cremated Sam McGee.
	Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
	Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
	He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
	Though he'd often say in his homely way that 'he'd sooner live in hell'.
	On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
	Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.
	If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
	It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.
	And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,
	And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,
	He turned to me, and 'Cap,' says he, 'I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
	And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.'
	Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
	'It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
	Yet 'taint being dead - it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
	So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.'
	A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
	And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.
	He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
	And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.
	There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,
	With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;
	It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: 'You may tax your brawn and brains,
	But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains.'
	Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.
	In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.
	In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,
	Howled out their woes to the homeless snows -O God! how I loathed the thing.
	And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
	And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
	The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
	And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.
	Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
	It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the 'Alice May.'
	And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
	Then 'Here,' said I, with a sudden cry, 'is my cre-ma-tor-eum.'
	Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
	Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
	The flames just soared, and the furnace roared - such a blaze you seldom see;
	And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.
	Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
	And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.
	It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
	And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.
	I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
	But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;
	I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: 'I'll just take a peep inside.
	I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked then the door I opened wide.
	And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
	And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: 'Please close that door.
	It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm -
	Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm.'There are strange things done in the midnight sun
	By the men who moil for gold;
	The Arctic trails have their secret tales
	That would make your blood run cold;
	The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
	But the queerest they ever did see
	Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
	I cremated Sam McGee.

	She walks in Beauty, like the night
	    Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
	And all that's best of dark and bright
	    Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
	Thus mellowed to that tender light
	    Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.
	One shade the more, one ray the less,
	    Had half impaired the nameless grace
	Which waves in every raven tress,
	    Or softly lightens o'er her face;
	Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
	    How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
	And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
	    So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
	The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
	    But tell of days in goodness spent,
	A mind at peace with all below,
	    A heart whose love is innocent!

Slowly, silently, now the moon
Walks the night in her silver shoon;
This way, and that, she peers, and sees
Silver fruit upon silver trees;
One by one the casements catch
Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;
Couched in his kennel, like a log,
With paws of silver sleeps the dog;
From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep
Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep;
A harvest mouse goes scampering by,
With silver claws, and silver eye;
And moveless fish in the water gleam,
By silver reeds in a silver stream.

    <Story nr="112" title="Ulysses"> 

It little profits that an idle king, 
By this still hearth, among these barren crags, 
Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole 
Unequal laws unto a savage race, 
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. 
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink 
Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd 
Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those 
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when 
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades 
Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; 
For always roaming with a hungry heart 
Much have I seen and known,— cities of men 
And manners, climates, councils, governments, 
Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,— 
And drunk delight of battle with my peers, 
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. 
I am a part of all that I have met; 
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' 
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades 
For ever and for ever when I move. 
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! 
As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life 
Were all too little, and of one to me 
Little remains; but every hour is saved 
From that eternal silence, something more, 
A bringer of new things; and vile it were 
For some three suns to store and hoard myself, 
And this gray spirit yearning in desire 
To follow knowledge like a sinking star, 
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 
	This is my son, mine own Telemachus, 
To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,— 
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill 
This labour, by slow prudence to make mild 
A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees 
Subdue them to the useful and the good. 
Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere 
Of common duties, decent not to fail 
In offices of tenderness, and pay 
Meet adoration to my household gods, 
When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. 
	There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; 
There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, 
Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,— 
That ever with a frolic welcome took 
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed 
Free hearts, free foreheads,— you and I are old; 
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. 
Death closes all; but something ere the end, 
Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. 
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; 
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep 
Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. 
Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' 
We are not now that strength which in old days 
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,— 
One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will 
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

My eyes already touch the sunny hill.
going far beyond the road I have begun,
So we are grasped by what we cannot grasp;
it has an inner light, even from a distance-

and changes us, even if we do not reach it,
into something else, which, hardly sensing it,
we already are; a gesture waves us on
answering our own wave…
but what we feel is the wind in our faces.Translated by Robert Bly

	We romped until the pans
	Slid from the kitchen shelf;
	My mother's countenance
	Could not unfrown itself.
	The hand that held my wrist
	Was battered on one knuckle;
	At every step you missed
	My right ear scraped a buckle.
	You beat time on my head
	With a palm caked hard by dirt,
	Then waltzed me off to bed
	Still clinging to your shirt.

	And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
	And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.
	I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
	Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
	And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
	And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
	I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
	To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like a whetted knife;
	And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
	And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.

    <Story nr="117" title="A Gleam Of Sunshine"> 

This is the place.  Stand still, my steed,
  Let me review the scene,
And summon from the shadowy Past
  The forms that once have been.

The Past and Present here unite
  Beneath Time's flowing tide,
Like footprints hidden by a brook,
  But seen on either side.

Here runs the highway to the town;
  There the green lane descends,
Through which I walked to church with thee,
  O gentlest of my friends!

The shadow of the linden-trees
  Lay moving on the grass;
Between them and the moving boughs,
  A shadow, thou didst pass.

Thy dress was like the lilies,
  And thy heart as pure as they:
One of God's holy messengers
  Did walk with me that day.

I saw the branches of the trees
  Bend down thy touch to meet,
The clover-blossoms in the grass
  Rise up to kiss thy feet,

"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
  Of earth and folly born!"
Solemnly sang the village choir
  On that sweet Sabbath morn.

Through the closed blinds the golden sun
  Poured in a dusty beam,
Like the celestial ladder seen
  By Jacob in his dream.

And ever and anon, the wind,
  Sweet-scented with the hay,
Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves
 That on the window lay.

Long was the good man's sermon,
  Yet it seemed not so to me;
For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,
  And still I thought of thee.

Long was the prayer he uttered,
  Yet it seemed not so to me;
For in my heart I prayed with him,
  And still I thought of thee.

But now, alas! the place seems changed;
  Thou art no longer here:
Part of the sunshine of the scene
  With thee did disappear.

Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,
  Like pine-trees dark and high,
Subdue the light of noon, and breathe
  A low and ceaseless sigh;

This memory brightens o'er the past,
  As when the sun, concealed
Behind some cloud that near us hangs
  Shines on a distant field.

I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling fingertips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!

There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.

     They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your
hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."
     "My mother is waiting for me at home, "I say, "How can I leave
her and come?"
     Then they smile and float away.
     But I know a nicer game than that, mother.
     I shall be the cloud and you the moon.
     I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will
be the blue sky.
     The folk who live in the waves call out to me-
     "We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know
not where we pass."
     I ask, "But how am I to join you?"
     They tell me, "Come to the edge of the shore and stand with
your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."
     I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the everything-
how can I leave her and go?"
     They smile, dance and pass by.
     But I know a better game than that.
     I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.
     I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with
laughter.
     And no one in the world will know where we both are.

Amongst the flowers I
am alone with my pot of wine
drinking by myself; then lifting
my cup I asked the moon
to drink with me, its reflection
and mine in the wine cup, just
the three of us; then I sigh
for the moon cannot drink,

and my shadow goes emptily along
with me never saying a word;
with no other friends here, I can
but use these two for company;
in the time of happiness, I
too must be happy with all
around me; I sit and sing
and it is as if the moon

accompanies me; then if I
dance, it is my shadow that
dances along with me; while
still not drunk, I am glad
to make the moon and my shadow
into friends, but then when
I have drunk too much, we
all part; yet these are

friends I can always count on
these who have no emotion
whatsoever; I hope that one day
we three will meet again,
deep in the Milky Way.

    <Story nr="122" title="For whom the Bell Tolls"> 

PERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he 
     knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so 
     much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my 
     state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that.  The 
     church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she 
     does belongs to all.  When she baptizes a child, that action 
     concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which 
     is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member. 
     And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is 
     of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is 
     not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; 
     and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several 
     translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, 
     some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every 
     translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves 
     again for that library where every book shall lie open to one 
     another.  As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not 
     upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this 
     bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the 
     door by this sickness.  There was a contention as far as a suit (in 
     which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were 
     mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers 
     first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring 
     first that rose earliest.  If we understand aright the dignity of 
     this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to 
     make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be 
     ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.  The bell doth toll for him 
     that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that 
     minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. 
     Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes 
     off his eye from a comet when that breaks out?  Who bends not his 
     ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove 
     it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this 
     world?  No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece 
     of the continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by 
     the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
     well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's 
     death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and 
     therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for 
     thee.  Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing 
     of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but 
     must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the 
     misery of our neighbours.  Truly it were an excusable covetousness 
     if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath 
     enough of it.  No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and 
     ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.  If a man 
     carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none 
     coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he 
     travels.  Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not 
     current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our 
     home, heaven, by it.  Another man may be sick too, and sick to 
     death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a 
     mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his 
     affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this 
     consideration of another's danger I take mine own into 
     contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my 
     God, who is our only security.

To have come near to the perfect love, 
Not the hot passion of untempered youth, 
But that which lies aside its vanity, 
And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.

But by what kept us from that perfect thing.

	I caught a tremendous fish
	and held him beside the boat
	half out of water, with my hook
	fast in a corner of his mouth.
	He didn't fight.
	He hadn't fought at all.
	He hung a grunting weight,
	battered and venerable
	and homely.  Here and there
	his brown skin hung in strips
	like ancient wallpaper,
	and its pattern of darker brown
	was like wallpaper:
	shapes like full-blown roses
	stained and lost through age.
	He was speckled with barnacles,
	fine rosettes of lime,
	and infested
	with tiny white sea-lice,
	and underneath two or three
	rags of green weed hung down.
	While his gills were breathing in
	the terrible oxygen
	—the frightening gills,
	fresh and crisp with blood,
	that can cut so badly—
	I thought of the coarse white flesh
	packed in like feathers,
	the big bones and the little bones,
	the dramatic reds and blacks
	of his shiny entrails,
	and the pink swim-bladder
	like a big peony.
	I looked into his eyes
	which were far larger than mine
	but shallower, and yellowed,
	the irises backed and packed
	with tarnished tinfoil
	seen through the lenses
	of old scratched isinglass.
	They shifted a little, but not
	to return my stare.
	—It was more like the tipping
	of an object toward the light.
	I admired his sullen face,
	the mechanism of his jaw,
	and then I saw
	that from his lower lip
	—if you could call it a lip
	grim, wet, and weaponlike,
	hung five old pieces of fish-line,
	or four and a wire leader
	with the swivel still attached,
	with all their five big hooks
	grown firmly in his mouth.
	A green line, frayed at the end
	where he broke it, two heavier lines,
	and a fine black thread
	still crimped from the strain and snap
	when it broke and he got away.
	Like medals with their ribbons
	frayed and wavering,
	a five-haired beard of wisdom
	trailing from his aching jaw.
	I stared and stared
	and victory filled up
	the little rented boat,
	from the pool of bilge
	where oil had spread a rainbow
	around the rusted engine
	to the bailer rusted orange,
	the sun-cracked thwarts,
	the oarlocks on their strings,
	the gunnels—until everything
	was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
	And I let the fish go.

Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, 
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - 
O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. 

I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known 
To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone 
And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. 
With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May 

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now 
Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow 
That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - 
When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.

    <Story nr="132" title="Fern Hill"> 

Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
The night above the dingle starry,
Time let me hail and climb
Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
Trail with daisies and barley
Down the rivers of the windfall light.

And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
In the sun that is young once only,
Time let me play and be
Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and
cold,
And the sabbath rang slowly
In the pebbles of the holy streams.

All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was
air
And playing, lovely and watery
And fire green as grass.
And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the
nightjars
Flying with the ricks, and the horses
Flashing into the dark.

And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
The sky gathered again
And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking
warm
Out of the whinnying green stable
On to the fields of praise.

And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
In the sun born over and over,
I ran my heedless ways,
My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
Before the children green and golden
Follow him out of grace.

Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would
take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
In the moon that is always rising,
Nor that riding to sleep
I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
Time held me green and dying
Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

    <Story nr="135" title="A Tear And A Smile"> 

I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart 
For the joys of the multitude.
And I would not have the tears that sadness makes 
To flow from my every part turn into laughter. 

I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.

A tear to purify my heart and give me understanding
Of life's secrets and hidden things. 
A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and 
To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.

A tear to unite me with those of broken heart; 
A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.

I would rather that I died in yearning and longing   than that I live Weary and despairing.

I want the hunger for love and beauty to be in the 
Depths of my spirit,for I have seen those who are 
Satisfied the most wretched of people. 
I have heard the sigh of those in yearning and Longing, and it is sweeter than the sweetest melody.

With evening's coming the flower folds her petals 
And sleeps, embracingher longing. 
At morning's approach she opens her lips to meet 
The sun's kiss.

The life of a flower is longing and fulfilment.
A tear and a smile.

The waters of the sea become vapor and rise and come 
Together and are a cloud.

And the cloud floats above the hills and valleys 
Until it meets the gentle breeze, then falls weeping 
To the fields and joins with brooks and rivers to Return to the sea, its home.

The life of clouds is a parting and a meeting. 
A tear and a smile.

And so does the spirit become separated from 
The greater spirit to move in the world of matter 
And pass as a cloud over the mountain of sorrow 
And the plains of joy to meet the breeze of death 
And return whence it came.

To the ocean of Love and Beauty----to God.

What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I
walked down the streets under the trees with a
headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.
In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went 
into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your 
enumerations!
What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families 
shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the 
avocados, babies in the tomatoes! - and you, Garcia Lorca, 
what were you doing down by the watermelons?

I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, 
poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing 
the grocery boys.
I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?
I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans 
following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.
We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary 
fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, 
and never passing the cashier.

Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?
(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)
Will we walk all night through solitary streets? 
The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.

Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past 
blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?
Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, 
what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood 
watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?

FERRARA
	That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,
	Looking as if she were alive.  I call
	That piece a wonder, now: Fr Pandolf's hands
	Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
	Will't please you sit and look at her? I said
	``Fr Pandolf'' by design, for never read
	Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
	The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
	But to myself they turned (since none puts by
	The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
	And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
	How such a glance came there; so, not the first
	Are you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas not
	Her husband's presence only, called that spot
	Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps
	Fr Pandolf chanced to say ``Her mantle laps
	``Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint
	``Must never hope to reproduce the faint
	``Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuff
	Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
	For calling up that spot of joy.  She had
	A heart—-how shall I say?—-too soon made glad,
	Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er
	She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.  
	Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,
	The dropping of the daylight in the West,
	The bough of cherries some officious fool
	Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
	She rode with round the terrace—-all and each
	Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
	Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,—-good! but thanked
	Somehow—-I know not how—-as if she ranked
	My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
	With anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blame
	This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
	In speech—-(which I have not)—-to make your will
	Quite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this
	``Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
	``Or there exceed the mark''—-and if she let
	Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
	Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,
	—-E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose
	Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,
	Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
	Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
	Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands
	As if alive.  Will't please you rise? We'll meet
	The company below, then.  I repeat,
	The Count your master's known munificence
	Is ample warrant that no just pretence
	Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
	Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed
	At starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll go
	Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
	Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
	Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

	                       Ships tempest-tossed
	             Will find a harbour in some bay,
	                       And so we may.
	             And there is nothing left to do
	               But to kiss once again, and part,

Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing

      Over the sky.
One after another the white clouds are fleeting;
Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating

      Full merrily;
   Yet all things must die.
The stream will cease to flow;
The wind will cease to blow;
The clouds will cease to fleet;
The heart will cease to beat;
   For all things must die.
      All things must die.
Spring will come never more.
      O, vanity!
Death waits at the door.
See! our friends are all forsaking
The wine and the merrymaking.
We are call’d–we must go.
Laid low, very low,
In the dark we must lie.
The merry glees are still;
The voice of the bird
Shall no more be heard,
Nor the wind on the hill.
      O, misery!
Hark! death is calling
While I speak to ye,
The jaw is falling,
The red cheek paling,
The strong limbs failing;
Ice with the warm blood mixing;
The eyeballs fixing.
Nine times goes the passing bell:
Ye merry souls, farewell.
      The old earth
      Had a birth,
      As all men know,
      Long ago.
And the old earth must die.
So let the warm winds range,
And the blue wave beat the shore;
For even and morn
Ye will never see
Thro’ eternity.

If you don't know the kind of person I am
and I don't know the kind of person you are
a pattern that others made may prevail in the world
and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,
a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break
sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood
storming out to play through the broken dyke.

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,
but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider—
lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

For it is important that awake people be awake,
or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;
the signals we give—yes or no, or maybe—
should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.

in every wood in every spring there is a different green.
I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago,
and people who will see a world that I shall never know.
But all the while I sit and think of times there were before,
I listen for returning feet and voices at the door.

    <Story nr="159" title="Amazing Grace"> 

Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound!) 
That sav'd a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears reliev'd;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believ'd!

Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home. 

The Lord has promis'd good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, 
And mortal life shall cease;
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

This earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call'd me here below,
Will be for ever mine. Faith's Review and Expectation. Olney Hymn # 41, vol. 1.The words were written c. 1772. They first appeared in print in Newton's Olney Hymns, 1779 that he worked on with William Cowper.
EXTRA Verses: 
"When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’ve first begun."

The first known use of this verse is by Harriet Beecher Stowe, in her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. It may have been taken from another hymn. This verse is part of most hymnals today.

"Oh, crime and virtue, virtue and crime! - it was old John Newton, I think, who, when he saw a man going to be hanged, said, 'There goes John Newton, but for the grace of God!'" ~ from the novel, 'Lavengro', by George Borrow.

I.

That fawn-skin-dappled hair of hers,
      And the blue eye
      Dear and dewy,
And that infantine fresh air of hers!

	II.

To think men cannot take you, Sweet,
      And enfold you,
      Ay, and hold you,
And so keep you what they make you, Sweet!

	III

You like us for a glance, you know—-
      For a word's sake
      Or a sword's sake,
All's the same, whate'er the chance, you know.

	IV.

And in turn we make you ours, we say—-
      You and youth too,
      Eyes and mouth too,
All the face composed of flowers, we say.

	V.

All's our own, to make the most of, Sweet—-
      Sing and say for,
      Watch and pray for,
Keep a secret or go boast of, Sweet!

	VI.

But for loving, why, you would not, Sweet,
      Though we prayed you,
      Paid you, brayed you
in a mortar—-for you could not, Sweet!

	VII.

So, we leave the sweet face fondly there:
      Be its beauty
      Its sole duty!
Let all hope of grace beyond, lie there!

	VIII.

And while the face lies quiet there,
      Who shall wonder
      That I ponder
A conclusion? I will try it there.

	IX.

As,—-why must one, for the love foregone,
      Scout mere liking?
      Thunder-striking
Earth,—-the heaven, we looked above for, gone!

	X.

Why, with beauty, needs there money be,
      Love with liking?
      Crush the fly-king
In his gauze, because no honey-bee?

	XI.

May not liking be so simple-sweet,
      If love grew there
      'Twould undo there
All that breaks the cheek to dimples sweet?

	XII.

Is the creature too imperfect,
      Would you mend it
      And so end it?
Since not all addition perfects aye!

	XIII.

Or is it of its kind, perhaps,
      Just perfection—-
      Whence, rejection
Of a grace not to its mind, perhaps?

	XIV.

Shall we burn up, tread that face at once
      Into tinder,
      And so hinder
Sparks from kindling all the place at once?

	XV.

Or else kiss away one's soul on her?
      Your love-fancies!
      —-A sick man sees
Truer, when his hot eyes roll on her!

	XVI.

Thus the craftsman thinks to grace the rose,—-
      Plucks a mould-flower
      For his gold flower,
Uses fine things that efface the rose:

	XVII.

Rosy rubies make its cup more rose,
      Precious metals
      Ape the petals,—-
Last, some old king locks it up, morose!

	XVIII.

Then how grace a rose? I know a way!
      Leave it, rather. 
      Must you gather?
Smell, kiss, wear it—-at last, throw away!

What is it to grow old?
Is it to lose the glory of the form,
The lustre of the eye?
Is it for beauty to forego her wreath?
Yes, but not for this alone.

Is it to feel our strength -
Not our bloom only, but our strength -decay?
Is it to feel each limb
Grow stiffer, every function less exact,
Each nerve more weakly strung?

Yes, this, and more! but not,
Ah, 'tis not what in youth we dreamed 'twould be!
'Tis not to have our life
Mellowed and softened as with sunset-glow,
A golden day's decline!

'Tis not to see the world
As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes,
And heart profoundly stirred;
And weep, and feel the fulness of the past,
The years that are no more!

It is to spend long days
And not once feel that we were ever young.
It is to add, immured
In the hot prison of the present, month
To month with weary pain.

It is to suffer this,
And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel:
Deep in our hidden heart
Festers the dull remembrance of a change,
But no emotion -none.

It is -last stage of all -
When we are frozen up within, and quite
The phantom of ourselves,
To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost
Which blamed the living man.

    <Story nr="167" title="Disabled"> 

He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark, 
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey, 
Legless, sewn short at elbow. Through the park 
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn, 
Voices of play and pleasure after day, 
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him. 

About this time Town used to swing so gay 
When glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees, 
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,- 
In the old times, before he threw away his knees. 
Now he will never feel again how slim 
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands. 
All of them touch him like some queer disease. 

There was an artist silly for his face, 
For it was younger than his youth, last year. 
Now, he is old; his back will never brace; 
He's lost his colour very far from here, 
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry, 
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race 
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh. 

One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg, 
After the matches, carried shoulder-high. 
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg, 
He thought he'd better join. - He wonders why. 
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts, 
That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg, 
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts 
He asked to join. He didn't have to beg; 
Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years. 

Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt, 
And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears 
Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts 
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes; 
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears; 
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits. 
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers. 

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal. 
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits 
Thanked him; and then enquired about his soul. 

Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes, 
And do what things the rules consider wise, 
And take whatever pity they may dole. 
Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes 
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole. 
How cold and late it is! Why don't they come 
And put him into bed? Why don't they come? Letter from Robert Graves to Wilfred Owen
[Circa 17 October 1917]

3rd Garr. Batt., R.W.F., Kinmel Park,
Rhy, N. Wales
Do you know, Owen, that's a damn fine poem of yours, that 'Disabled.' Really damn fine!
So good the general sound and weight of the words that the occasional metrical outrages are most surprising. It's like seeing a golfer drive onto the green in one and then use a cleek instead of a putter, &amp; hole out in twelve.

For instance you have a foot too much in

In the old days before he gave away his knees
&amp; in He wasn't bothered much by Huns or crimes or guilts
&amp; They cheered him home but not as they would cheer a goal
&amp; Now he will spend a few sick years in institutes

There is an occasional jingle

Voices of boys
&amp; Voices of play and pleasure after day

And an occasional cliché

Girls glanced lovelier
scanty suits of grey

I wouldn't worry to metion all this if it wasn't for my violent pleasure at some of the lines like the one about the 'solemn man who brought him fruits' &amp; the 'jewelled hilts of daggers in plaid socks' &amp; the 'Bloodsmear down his leg after the matches'.

Owen, you have seen things; you are a poet; but you're a very careless one at present. One can't put in too many syllables into a line &amp; say 'Oh, it's all right. That's my way of writing poetry'. One has to follow the rules of the meter one adopts. Make new meters by all means, but one must observe the rules where they are laid down by a custom of centuries. A painter or musician has no greater task in mastering his colours or his musical modes &amp; harmonies, than a poet.

It's the devil of a sweat for him to get to know the value of his rhymes, rhythms or sentiments. But I have no doubt at all that if you turned seriously to writing, you could obtain Parnassus in no time while I'm still struggling on the knees of that stubborn peak.

Till then, good luck in the good work. Yours Robert Graves.

I sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed.
Inaction, no falsifying dream
Between my hooked head and hooked feet:
Or in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat.

The convenience of the high trees!
The air's buoyancy and the sun's ray
Are of advantage to me;
And the earth's face upward for my inspection.

My feet are locked upon the rough bark.
It took the whole of Creation
To produce my foot, my each feather:
Now I hold Creation in my foot

Or fly up, and revolve it all slowly -
I kill where I please because it is all mine.
There is no sophistry in my body:
My manners are tearing off heads -

The allotment of death.
For the one path of my flight is direct
Through the bones of the living.
No arguments assert my right:

The sun is behind me.
Nothing has changed since I began.
My eye has permitted no change.
I am going to keep things like this.

    <Story nr="169" title="A Code of Morals"> 

Now Jones had left his new-wed bride to keep his house in order,
And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border,
To sit on a rock with a heliograph; but ere he left he taught
His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught.

And Love had made him very sage, as Nature made her fair;
So Cupid and Apollo linked , per heliograph, the pair.
At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise —
At e'en, the dying sunset bore her husband's homilies.

He warned her 'gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold,
As much as 'gainst the blandishments paternal of the old;
But kept his gravest warnings for (hereby the ditty hangs)
That snowy-haired Lothario, Lieutenant-General Bangs.

'Twas General Bangs, with Aide and Staff, who tittupped on the way,
When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play.
They thought of Border risings, and of stations sacked and burnt —
So stopped to take the message down — and this is whay they learnt —

"Dash dot dot, dot, dot dash, dot dash dot" twice. The General swore.
"Was ever General Officer addressed as 'dear' before?
"'My Love,' i' faith! 'My Duck,' Gadzooks! 'My darling popsy-wop!'
"Spirit of great Lord Wolseley, who is on that mountaintop?"

The artless Aide-de-camp was mute; the gilded Staff were still,
As, dumb with pent-up mirth, they booked that message from the hill;
For clear as summer lightning-flare, the husband's warning ran: —
"Don't dance or ride with General Bangs — a most immoral man."

[At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise —
But, howsoever Love be blind, the world at large hath eyes.]
With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife
Some interesting details of the General's private life.

The artless Aide-de-camp was mute, the shining Staff were still,
And red and ever redder grew the General's shaven gill.
And this is what he said at last (his feelings matter not): —
"I think we've tapped a private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!"

All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know
By word or act official who read off that helio.
But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Mooltan
They know the worthy General as "that most immoral man."

Is there for honesty poverty 
That hings his head, an' a' that; 
The coward slave - we pass him by, 
We dare be poor for a' that! 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
Our toils obscure an' a' that, 
The rank is but the guinea's stamp, 
The man's the gowd for a' that. 

What though on hamely fare we dine, 
Wear hoddin grey, an' a' that? 
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, 
A man's a man for a' that. 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
Their tinsel show, an' a' that, 
The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, 
Is king o' men for a' that. 

Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord, 
Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that; 
Tho' hundreds worship at his word, 
He's but a coof for a' that. 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
His ribband, star, an' a' that, 
The man o' independent mind 
He looks an' laughs at a' that.

A marquise, duke, an' a' that;

For a' that, an' a' that,
It's comin yet for a' that 
That man to man, the world o'er, 
Shall brithers be for a' that.This has been set to music, and you may have heard it sung. It is written in Ayrshire dialect, and English, but the sentiments expressed are universal. 
In Verse One, Burns is saying that wealth, or lack of it,and social class should  not be the measure of a man's true worth. " The rank is but the guinea's stamp" means that a person cannot be given a price. The man's character is the true gold.

Verse Two continues the theme. We may wear ordinary clothes, and eat simple food, but appearance is just a show, like tinsel. Honesty is worth more than fancy clothes.

Now Verse Three might have got Burns into some trouble in Edinburgh. The birkie (cool young guy) who struts around, and has the title of Lord, is only a coof (an idiot). The man who learns to think for himself is worth much more than that.

Verse Four continues this theme. Princes can hand out titles at will, but honesty and pure goodness are worth much more. Self respect doesn't come from inherited wealth or titles.

Verse Five is a prayer that Sense and Worth shall eventually agree with all mankind. Burns imagines a future world in which all people will live as brothers, in mutual trust and respect. "It's coming yet, for a' that". Well, it hasn't come yet Rabbie, but we live in hope.

    <Story nr="177" title="The Horses"> 


	Barely a twelvemonth after
	The seven days war that put the world to sleep,
	Late in the evening the strange horses came.
	By then we had made our covenant with silence,
	But in the first few days it was so still
	We listened to our breathing and were afraid.
	On the second day
	The radios failed; we turned the knobs; no answer.
	On the third day a warship passed us, heading north,
	Dead bodies piled on the deck. On the sixth day
	A plane plunged over us into the sea. Thereafter
	Nothing. The radios dumb;
	And still they stand in corners of our kitchens,
	And stand, perhaps, turned on, in a million rooms
	All over the world. But now if they should speak,
	If on a sudden they should speak again,
	If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak,
	We would not listen, we would not let it bring
	That old bad world that swallowed its children quick
	At one great gulp. We would not have it again.
	Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep,
	Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow,
	And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness.
	The tractors lie about our fields; at evening
	They look like dank sea-monsters couched and waiting.
	We leave them where they are and let them rust:
	"They'll molder away and be like other loam."
	We make our oxen drag our rusty plows,
	Long laid aside. We have gone back
	Far past our fathers' land.
	And then, that evening
	Late in the summer the strange horses came.
	We heard a distant tapping on the road,
	A deepening drumming; it stopped, went on again
	And at the corner changed to hollow thunder.
	We saw the heads
	Like a wild wave charging and were afraid.
	We had sold our horses in our fathers' time
	To buy new tractors. Now they were strange to us
	As fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield.
	Or illustrations in a book of knights.
	We did not dare go near them. Yet they waited,
	Stubborn and shy, as if they had been sent
	By an old command to find our whereabouts
	And that long-lost archaic companionship.
	In the first moment we had never a thought
	That they were creatures to be owned and used.
	Among them were some half a dozen colts
	Dropped in some wilderness of the broken world,
	Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden.
	Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loads,
	But that free servitude still can pierce our hearts.
	Our life is changed; their coming our beginning.

A moment of happiness,
you and I sitting on the verandah,
apparently two, but one in soul, you and I.
We feel the flowing water of life here,

The stars will be watching us,

Give all to love;
Obey thy heart;
Friends, kindred, days,
Estate, good fame,
Plans, credit, and the muse;
Nothing refuse.

'Tis a brave master,
Let it have scope,
Follow it utterly,
Hope beyond hope;
High and more high,
It dives into noon,
With wing unspent,
Untold intent;
But 'tis a god,
Knows its own path,
And the outlets of the sky.
'Tis not for the mean,
It requireth courage stout,
Souls above doubt,
Valor unbending;
Such 'twill reward,
They shall return
More than they were,
And ever ascending.

Leave all for love;—
Yet, hear me, yet,
One word more thy heart behoved,
One pulse more of firm endeavor,
Keep thee to-day,
To-morrow, for ever,
Free as an Arab
Of thy beloved.
Cling with life to the maid;
But when the surprise,
Vague shadow of surmise,
Flits across her bosom young
Of a joy apart from thee,
Free be she, fancy-free,
Do not thou detain a hem,
Nor the palest rose she flung
From her summer diadem.

Though thou loved her as thyself,
As a self of purer clay,
Tho' her parting dims the day,
Stealing grace from all alive,
Heartily know,
When half-gods go,
The gods arrive.

    <Story nr="183" title="Rain"> 

Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain
On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me
Remembering again that I shall die
And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks
For washing me cleaner than I have been
Since I was born into this solitude.
Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon:
But here I pray that none whom once I loved
Is dying tonight or lying still awake
Solitary, listening to the rain,
Either in pain or thus in sympathy
Helpless among the living and the dead,
Like a cold water among broken reeds,
Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff,
Like me who have no love which this wild rain
Has not dissolved except the love of death,
If love it be for what is perfect and
Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.This is reminiscent of a passage Thomas wrote in a book “The Icknield Way” published 3 years earlier
“I am alone in the dark still night, and my ear listens to the rain piping in the gutters and roar- ing softly in the trees of the world. Even so will the rain fall darkly upon the grass over the grave when my ears can hear it no more. I have been glad of the sound of rain, and wildly sad of it in the past; but that is all over as if it had never been; my eye is dull and my heart beating evenly and quietly; I stir neither foot nor hand; I shall not be quieter when I lie under the wet grass and the rain falls, and I of less account than the grass. . . .
Black and monotonously sounding is the mid- night and solitude of the rain. In a little while or in an age—for it is all one—I shall know the full truth of the words I used to love, I knew not why, in my days of nature, in the days before the rain: 'Blessed are the dead that the rain rains on.' ”

Always be drunk.
 That's it!
 The great imperative!
 In order not to feel
 Time's horrid fardel
 bruise your shoulders,
 grinding you into the earth,
 Get drunk and stay that way.
 On what?
 On  wine, poetry, virtue, whatever.
 But get drunk.
 And if you sometimes happen to wake up
 on the porches of a palace,
 in the green grass of a ditch,
 in the dismal loneliness of your own room,
 your drunkenness gone or disappearing,
 ask the wind,
 the wave,
 the star,
 the bird,
 the clock,
 ask everything that flees,
 everything that groans
 or rolls
 or sings,
 everything that speaks,
 ask what time it is;
 and the wind,
 the wave,
 the star,
 the bird,
 the clock
 will answer you:
 "Time to get drunk!
 Don't be martyred slaves of Time,
 Get drunk!
 Stay drunk!
 On wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!"Original French version:

Enivrez-Vous
Il faut être toujours ivre.
Tout est là:
c'est l'unique question.
Pour ne pas sentir

qui brise vos épaules
et vous penche vers la terre,
il faut vous enivrer sans trêve.
Mais de quoi?
De vin, de poésie, ou de vertu, à votre guise.
Mais enivrez-vous.
Et si quelquefois,
sur les marches d'un palais,
sur l'herbe verte d'un fossé,
dans la solitude morne de votre chambre,
vous vous réveillez,
l'ivresse déjà diminuée ou disparue,
demandez au vent,
à la vague,
à l'étoile,
à l'oiseau,
à l'horloge,
à tout ce qui fuit,
à tout ce qui gémit,
à tout ce qui roule,
à tout ce qui chante,
à tout ce qui parle,
demandez quelle heure il est;
et le vent,
la vague,

vous répondront:
"Il est l'heure de s'enivrer!
Pour n'être pas les esclaves martyrisés du Temps,

His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.

As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a center
in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.

Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly—. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.

By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.

My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.

The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.

I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—,
then pushed her over the edge into the river.

Or "Don't punch your sister."
You wouldn't even have sisters.

If I were in charge of the world
A chocolate sundae with whipped cream and nuts would be a vegetable

Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; 
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink 
And rise and sink and rise and sink again; 
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, 
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; 
Yet many a man is making friends with death 
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. 
It well may be that in a difficult hour, 
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, 
Or nagged by want past resolution's power, 
I might be driven to sell your love for peace, 
Or trade the memory of this night for food. 
It well may be. I do not think I would.

If I could live again my life,
In the next - I'll try,
- to make more mistakes,
I won't try to be so perfect,
I'll be more relaxed,
I'll be more full - than I am now,
In fact, I'll take fewer things seriously,
I'll be less hygenic,
I'll take more risks,
I'll take more trips,
I'll watch more sunsets,
I'll climb more mountains,
I'll swim more rivers,
I'll go to more places - I've never been,
I'll eat more ice creams and less (lime) beans,
I'll have more real problems - and less imaginary
ones,
I was one of those people who live
prudent and prolific lives -
each minute of his life,
Offcourse that I had moments of joy - but,
if I could go back I'll try to have only good moments,

If you don't know - thats what life is made of,
Don't lose the now!

I was one of those who never goes anywhere
without a thermometer,
without a hot-water bottle,
and without an umberella and without a parachute,

If I could live again - I will travel light,
If I could live again - I'll try to work bare feet
at the beginning of spring till
the end of autumn,
I'll ride more carts,
I'll watch more sunrises and play with more children,
If I have the life to live - but now I am 85,
- and I know that I am dying ...

I knew a simple soldier boy
Who grinned at life in empty joy,
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,
And whistled early with the lark.

In winter trenches, cowed and glum,
With crumps and lice and lack of rum,
He put a bullet through his brain.
No one spoke of him again.

Who cheer when soldier lads march by,
Sneak home and pray you'll never know
The hell where youth and laughter go.

    <Story nr="197" title="Flower of Love"> 

Sweet, I blame you not, for mine the fault was, had I not been made of common 
clay
I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet, seen the fuller air, the 
larger day.

From the wildness of my wasted passion I had struck a better, clearer song,
Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled with some Hydra-headed wrong.

Had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed,
You had walked with Bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled meed.

I had trod the road which Dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine,
Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening, as they opened to the Florentine.

And the mighty nations would have crowned me, who am crownless now and without 
name,
And some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the House of 
Fame.

I had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young,
And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the lyre's strings are ever strung.

Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppy-seeded wine,
With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead, clasped the hand of noble love in 
mine.

And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush the burnished bosom of the 
dove,
Two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love;

Would have read the legend of my passion, known the bitter secret of my heart,
Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as we two are fated now to part.

For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth,
And no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth.

Yet I am not sorry that I loved you -ah! what else had I a boy to do? - 
For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the silent-footed years pursue.

Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and when once the storm of youth is 
past,
Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death the silent pilot comes at last.

And within the grave there is no pleasure, for the blindworm battens on the 
root,
And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree of Passion bears no fruit.

Ah! what else had I to do but love you? God's own mother was less dear to me,
And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea.

I have made my choice, have lived my poems, and, though youth is gone in 
wasted days,
I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better than the poet's crown of bays.

    <Story nr="199" title="Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"> 

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, 
        The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
    The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
        And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

    Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,
        And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
    Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
        And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

    Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
       The moping owl does to the moon complain
   Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
       Molest her ancient solitary reign.

   Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
       Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,
   Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
       The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

   The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
       The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
   The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
       No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

   For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
       Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
   No children run to lisp their sire's return,
       Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

   Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
       Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
   How jocund did they drive their team afield!
       How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

   Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
       Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
   Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
       The short and simple annals of the poor.

   The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
       And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
   Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.
       The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

   Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,
       If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
   Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
       The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

   Can storied urn or animated bust
       Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
   Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
       Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?

   Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
       Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
   Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
       Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre.

   But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page
       Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;
   Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
       And froze the genial current of the soul.

   Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
       The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
   Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,
       And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

   Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast
       The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
   Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
        Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.

   Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,
       The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
   To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
       And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,

   Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone
       Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;
   Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
       And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

   The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
       To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
   Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
       With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.

   Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
       Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
   Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
       They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

   Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
       Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
   With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
       Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

   Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
       The place of fame and elegy supply:
   And many a holy text around she strews,
       That teach the rustic moralist to die.

   For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
       This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
   Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
       Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

   On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
       Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
   Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
       Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

   For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
       Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
   If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
       Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

   Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
       "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
   Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
     To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

  "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
     That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
  His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
     And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

  "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
     Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
  Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
     Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

  "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
     Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
  Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
     Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

  "The next with dirges due in sad array
     Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
  Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
     Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

THE EPITAPH


  Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
    A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.  
  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,  
    And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.  

  Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,  
    Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:

Time wears her not; she doth his chariot guide; 
       Mortality below her orb is placed.
                                             -Raleigh 

The full-orbed moon with unchanged ray 
   Mounts up the eastern sky, 
Not doomed to these short nights for aye, 
   But shining steadily. 

She does not wane, but my fortune, 
   Which her rays do not bless, 
My wayward path declineth soon, 
   But she shines not the less. 

And if she faintly glimmers here, 
   And paled is her light, 
Yet alway in her proper sphere 
   She's mistress of the night.

I do not think of you lying in the wet clay
Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see
You walking down a lane among the poplars
On your way to the station, or happily

Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday -
You meet me and you say:
'Don't forget to see about the cattle - '
Among your earthiest words the angels stray.

And I think of you walking along a headland
Of green oats in June,
So full of repose, so rich with life -
And I see us meeting at the end of a town

On a fair day by accident, after
The bargains are all made and we can walk
Together through the shops and stalls and markets
Free in the oriental streets of thought.

O you are not lying in the wet clay,
For it is a harvest evening now and we
Are piling up the ricks against the moonlight
And you smile up at us  - eternally.

Like the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise:

With the love of the storm he burns,
He sings, he laughs, well I know how,
But forgets when he returns
As I shall not forget her 'Go now'.

Those two words shut a door
Between me and the blessed rain
That was never shut before
And will not open again.

	I have done it again.
	  One year in every ten
	  I manage it——
	 
	  A sort of walking miracle, my skin
	  Bright as a Nazi lampshade,
	  My right foot
	 
	  A paperweight,
	  My face a featureless, fine
	  Jew linen.
	 
	  Peel off the napkin
	  0 my enemy.
	  Do I terrify?——
	 
	  The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?
	  The sour breath
	  Will vanish in a day.
	 
	  Soon, soon the flesh
	  The grave cave ate will be
	  At home on me
	 
	  And I a smiling woman.
	  I am only thirty.
	  And like the cat I have nine times to die.
	 
	  This is Number Three.
	  What a trash
	  To annihilate each decade.
	 
	  What a million filaments.
	  The peanut-crunching crowd
	  Shoves in to see
	 
	  Them unwrap me hand and foot
	  The big strip tease.
	  Gentlemen, ladies
	 
	  These are my hands
	  My knees.
	  I may be skin and bone,
	 
	  Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.
	  The first time it happened I was ten.
	  It was an accident.
	 
	  The second time I meant
	  To last it out and not come back at all.
	  I rocked shut
	 
	  As a seashell.
	  They had to call and call
	  And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.
	 
	  Dying
	  Is an art, like everything else,
	  I do it exceptionally well.
	 
	  I do it so it feels like hell.
	  I do it so it feels real.
	  I guess you could say I've a call.
	 
	  It's easy enough to do it in a cell.
	  It's easy enough to do it and stay put.
	  It's the theatrical
	 
	  Comeback in broad day
	  To the same place, the same face, the same brute
	  Amused shout:
	 
	  'A miracle!'
	  That knocks me out.
	  There is a charge
	 
	  For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge
	  For the hearing of my heart——
	  It really goes.
	 
	  And there is a charge, a very large charge
	  For a word or a touch
	  Or a bit of blood
	 
	  Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.
	  So, so, Herr Doktor.
	  So, Herr Enemy.
	 
	  I am your opus,
	  I am your valuable,
	  The pure gold baby
	 
	  That melts to a shriek.
	  I turn and burn.
	  Do not think I underestimate your great concern.
	 
	  Ash, ash —-
	  You poke and stir.
	  Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——
	 
	  A cake of soap,
	  A wedding ring,
	  A gold filling.
	 
	  Herr God, Herr Lucifer
	  Beware
	  Beware.
	 
	  Out of the ash
	  I rise with my red hair
	  And I eat men like air.

    <Story nr="205" title="A Wish"> 

I ask not that my bed of death
From bands of greedy heirs be free;
For these besiege the latest breath
Of fortune's favoured sons, not me.

I ask not each kind soul to keep
Tearless, when of my death he hears;
Let those who will, if any, weep!
There are worse plagues on earth than tears.

I ask but that my death may find
The freedom to my life denied;
Ask but the folly of mankind,
Then, at last, to quit my side.

Spare me the whispering, crowded room,
The friends who come, and gape, and go;
The ceremonious air of gloom -
All which makes death a hideous show!

Nor bring, to see me cease to live,
Some doctor full of phrase and fame,
To shake his sapient head and give
The ill he cannot cure a name.

Nor fetch, to take the accustomed toll
Of the poor sinner bound for death,
His brother doctor of the soul,
To canvass with official breath

The future and its viewless things -
That undiscovered mystery
Which one who feels death's winnowing wings
Must need read clearer, sure, than he!

Bring none of these; but let me be,
While all around in silence lies,
Moved to the window near, and see
Once more before my dying eyes

Bathed in the sacred dew of morn
The wide aerial landscape spread -
The world which was ere I was born,
The world which lasts when I am dead.

Which never was the friend of one,
Nor promised love it could not give,
But lit for all its generous sun,
And lived itself, and made us live.

There let me gaze, till I become
In soul with what I gaze on wed!
To feel the universe my home;
To have before my mind -instead

Of the sick-room, the mortal strife,
The turmoil for a little breath -
The pure eternal course of life,
Not human combatings with death.

Thus feeling, gazing, let me grow
Composed, refreshed, ennobled, clear;
Then willing let my spirit go
To work or wait elsewhere or here!

HOG Butcher for the World,
     Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
     Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight

     Stormy, husky, brawling,
     City of the Big Shoulders:
They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I

And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it

And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the

Come and show me another city with lifted head singing

Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on

    <Story nr="207" title="Childhood"> 

Childhood, sweet and sunny childhood,
         With its careless, thoughtless air,
     Like the verdant, tangled wildwood,
         Wants the training hand of care.
     See it springing all around us —
         Glad to know, and quick to learn;
     Asking questions that confound us;
         Teaching lessons in its turn.
     Who loves not its joyous revel,
        Leaping lightly on the lawn,
    Up the knoll, along the level,
        Free and graceful as a fawn?
    Let it revel; it is nature
        Giving to the little dears
    Strength of limb, and healthful features,
        For the toil of coming years.
    He who checks a child with terror,
        Stops its play, and stills its song,
    Not alone commits an error,
        But a great and moral wrong.
    Give it play, and never fear it —
        Active life is no defect;
    Never, never break its spirit —
        Curb it only to direct.
    Would you dam the flowing river,
        Thinking it would cease to flow?
    Onward it must go forever —
        Better teach it where to go.
    Childhood is a fountain welling,
        Trace its channel in the sand,
    And its currents, spreading, swelling,
        Will revive the withered land.
    Childhood is the vernal season;
        Trim and train the tender shoot;
    Love is to the coming reason,
        As the blossom to the fruit.
    Tender twigs are bent and folded —
        Art to nature beauty lends;
    Childhood easily is moulded;
        Manhood breaks, but seldom bends.

To and fro, to and fro
In my little boat I go
Sailing far across the sea
All alone, just little me.
And the sea is big and strong
And the journey very long.
To and fro, to and fro
In my little boat I go.

Sea and sky, sea and sky,
Quietly on the deck I lie,
Having just a little rest.
I have really done my best
In an awful pirate fight,
But we captured them all right.
Sea and sky, sea and sky,
Quietly on the deck I lie—

Far away, far away
From my home and from my play,
On a journey without end
Only with the sea for friend
And the fishes in the sea.
But they swim away from me
Far away, far away
From my home and from my play.

    <Story nr="210" title="Conscience"> 

Conscience is instinct bred in the house, 
Feeling and Thinking propagate the sin 
By an unnatural breeding in and in. 
I say, Turn it out doors, 
Into the moors. 
I love a life whose plot is simple, 
And does not thicken with every pimple, 
A soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it, 
That makes the universe no worse than 't finds it. 
I love an earnest soul, 
Whose mighty joy and sorrow 
Are not drowned in a bowl, 
And brought to life to-morrow; 
That lives one tragedy, 
And not seventy; 
A conscience worth keeping; 
Laughing not weeping; 
A conscience wise and steady, 
And forever ready; 
Not changing with events, 
Dealing in compliments; 
A conscience exercised about 
Large things, where one may doubt. 
I love a soul not all of wood, 
Predestinated to be good, 
But true to the backbone 
Unto itself alone, 
And false to none; 
Born to its own affairs, 
Its own joys and own cares; 
By whom the work which God begun 
Is finished, and not undone; 
Taken up where he left off, 
Whether to worship or to scoff; 
If not good, why then evil, 
If not good god, good devil. 
Goodness! you hypocrite, come out of that, 
Live your life, do your work, then take your hat. 
I have no patience towards 
Such conscientious cowards. 
Give me simple laboring folk, 
Who love their work, 
Whose virtue is song 
To cheer God along.

    <Story nr="211" title="On Imagination"> 

Thy various works, imperial queen, we see,
  How bright their forms! how deck'd with pomp
    by thee!
Thy wond'rous acts in beauteous order stand,
And all attest how potent is thine hand.
  From Helicon's refulgent heights attend,
Ye sacred choir, and my attempts befriend:
To tell her glories with a faithful tongue,
Ye blooming graces, triumph in my song.
     Now here, now there, the roving Fancy flies,
Till some lov'd object strikes her wand'ring eyes,
Whose silken fetters all the senses bind,
And soft captivity involves the mind.
  Imagination! who can sing thy force?
Or who describe the swiftness of thy course?
Soaring through air to find the bright abode,
Th' empyreal palace of the thund'ring God,
We on thy pinions can surpass the wind,
And leave the rolling universe behind:
From star to star the mental optics rove,
Measure the skies, and range the realms above.
There in one view we grasp the mighty whole,
Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul.
  Though Winter frowns to Fancy's raptur'd eyes
The fields may flourish, and gay scenes arise;
The frozen deeps may break their iron bands,
And bid their waters murmur o'er the sands.
Fair Flora may resume her fragrant reign,
And with her flow'ry riches deck the plain;
Sylvanus may diffuse his honours round,
And all the forest may with leaves be crown'd:
Show'rs may descend, and dews their gems disclose,
And nectar sparkle on the blooming rose.
  Such is thy pow'r, nor are thine orders vain,
O thou the leader of the mental train:
In full perfection all thy works are wrought,
And thine the sceptre o'er the realms of thought.
Before thy throne the subject-passions bow,
Of subject-passions sov'reign ruler thou;
At thy command joy rushes on the heart,
And through the glowing veins the spirits dart.
  Fancy might now her silken pinions try
To rise from earth, and sweep th' expanse on high:
From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise,
Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,
While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.
The monarch of the day I might behold,
And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold,
But I reluctant leave the pleasing views,
Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse;
Winter austere forbids me to aspire,
And northern tempests damp the rising fire;
They chill the tides of Fancy's flowing sea,
Cease then, my song, cease the unequal lay.

So we'll go no more a-roving
   So late into the night,
Though the heart still be as loving,
   And the moon still be as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
   And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
   And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
   And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
   By the light of the moon.This poem was written in a letter to Thomas Moore and describes the weariness of age. Byron, 29 when it was written, was recovering from fatigue, probably brought on by over-indulgence.

The poem would appear to be based on the chorus of a Scottish song entitled “The Jolly Beggar” which was published in Herd’s “Scots Songs” in 1776, 41 years earlier.

    <Story nr="214" title="Sunday Morning"> 

1

Complacencies of the peignoir, and late
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the green freedom of a cockatoo
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,
As a calm darkens among water-lights.
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings
Seem things in some procession of the dead,
Winding across wide water, without sound.
The day is like wide water, without sound.
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.

2

Why should she give her bounty to the dead?
What is divinity if it can come
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,
In pungent fruit and bright green wings, or else
In any balm or beauty of the earth,
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?
Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch.
These are the measure destined for her soul.

3

Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.
He moved among us, as a muttering king,
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,
With heaven, brought such requital to desire
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,
A part of labor and a part of pain,
And next in glory to enduring love,
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.

4

She says, "I am content when wakened birds,
Before they fly, test the reality 
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?"
There is not any haunt of prophecy,
Nor any old chimera of the grave,
Neither the golden underground, nor isle
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured
As April's green endures; or will endure
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped
By the consummation of the swallow's wings.

5

She says, "But in contentment I still feel
The need of some imperishable bliss."
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,
Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves
Of sure obliteration on our paths,
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love
Whispered a little out of tenderness,
She makes the willow shiver in the sun
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.

6

Is there no change of death in paradise?
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,
With rivers like our own that seek for seas
They never find, the same receding shores
That never touch with inarticulate pang?
Why set pear upon those river-banks
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?
Alas, that they should wear our colors there,
The silken weavings of our afternoons,
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,
Within whose burning bosom we devise
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.

7

Supple and turbulent, a ring of men
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn
Their boisterous devotion to the sun,
Not as a god, but as a god might be,
Naked among them, like a savage source.
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,
Out of their blood, returning to the sky;
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,
The windy lake wherein their lord delights,
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,
That choir among themselves long afterward.
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship
Of men that perish and of summer morn.
And whence they came and whither they shall go
The dew upon their feel shall manifest.

8

She hears, upon that water without sound,
A voice that cries, "The tomb in Palestine
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay."
We live in an old chaos of the sun,
Or old dependency of day and night,
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,
Of that wide water, inescapable.
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;
And, in the isolation of the sky,
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.

This house has been far out at sea all night,
The woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,
Winds stampeding the fields under the window
Floundering black astride and blinding wet 

Till day rose; then under an orange sky
The hills had new places, and wind wielded
Blade-light, luminous black and emerald,
Flexing like the lens of a mad eye. 

At noon I scaled along the house-side as far as
The coal-house door. Once I looked up -
Through the brunt wind that dented the balls of my eyes
The tent of the hills drummed and strained its guyrope, 

The fields quivering, the skyline a grimace,
At any second to bang and vanish with a flap;
The wind flung a magpie away and a black-
Back gull bent like an iron bar slowly. The house 

Rang like some fine green goblet in the note
That any second would shatter it. Now deep
In chairs, in front of the great fire, we grip
Our hearts and cannot entertain book, thought, 

Or each other. We watch the fire blazing,
And feel the roots of the house move, but sit on,
Seeing the window tremble to come in,
Hearing the stones cry out under the horizons.

    <Story nr="219" title="A Barefoot Boy"> 

A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play — 
       For May is here once more, and so is he, — 
       His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee, 
     And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they: 
     Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array 
       Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me 
       Of woody pathways winding endlessly 
     Along the creek, where even yesterday 
     He plunged his shrinking body — gasped and shook — 
      Yet called the water "warm," with never lack 
    Of joy. And so, half enviously I look 
      Upon this graceless barefoot and his track, — 
      His toe stubbed — ay, his big toe-nail knocked back 
    Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook.

    <Story nr="221" title="Knee-Deep in June"> 

Tell you what I like the best — 
         'Long about knee-deep in June, 
      'Bout the time strawberries melts 
   On the vine, — some afternoon 
Like to jes' git out and rest, 
       And not work at nothin' else! 

Orchard's where I'd ruther be — 
Needn't fence it in fer me! — 
   Jes' the whole sky overhead, 
And the whole airth underneath — 
Sort o' so's a man kin breathe 
   Like he ort, and kind o' has 
Elbow-room to keerlessly 
   Sprawl out len'thways on the grass 
      Where the shadders thick and soft 
As the kivvers on the bed 
      Mother fixes in the loft 
Allus, when they's company! 

Jes' a-sort o' lazin there - 
   S'lazy, 'at you peek and peer 
      Through the wavin' leaves above, 
      Like a feller 'ats in love 
   And don't know it, ner don't keer! 
   Ever'thing you hear and see 
      Got some sort o' interest - 
      Maybe find a bluebird's nest 
   Tucked up there conveenently 
   Fer the boy 'at's ap' to be 
   Up some other apple tree! 
Watch the swallers skootin' past 
Bout as peert as you could ast; 
   Er the Bob-white raise and whiz 
   Where some other's whistle is. 

Ketch a shadder down below, 
And look up to find the crow — 
Er a hawk, - away up there, 
'Pearantly froze in the air! — 
   Hear the old hen squawk, and squat 
   Over ever' chick she's got, 
Suddent-like! - and she knows where 
   That-air hawk is, well as you! — 
   You jes' bet yer life she do! — 
      Eyes a-glitterin' like glass, 
      Waitin' till he makes a pass! 

Pee-wees wingin', to express 
   My opinion, 's second-class, 
Yit you'll hear 'em more er less; 
      Sapsucks gittin' down to biz, 
Weedin' out the lonesomeness; 
   Mr. Bluejay, full o' sass, 
      In them baseball clothes o' his, 
Sportin' round the orchad jes' 
Like he owned the premises! 
      Sun out in the fields kin sizz, 
But flat on yer back, I guess, 
      In the shade's where glory is! 
That's jes' what I'd like to do 
Stiddy fer a year er two! 

Plague! Ef they ain't somepin' in 
Work 'at kind o' goes ag'in' 
   My convictions! - 'long about 
      Here in June especially! — 
      Under some ole apple tree, 
         Jes' a-restin through and through, 
   I could git along without 
         Nothin' else at all to do 
         Only jes' a-wishin' you 
Wuz a-gittin' there like me, 
And June wuz eternity! 

Lay out there and try to see 
Jes' how lazy you kin be! — 
      Tumble round and souse yer head 
In the clover-bloom, er pull 
         Yer straw hat acrost yer eyes 
         And peek through it at the skies, 
      Thinkin' of old chums 'ats dead, 
            Maybe, smilin' back at you 
In betwixt the beautiful 
            Clouds o'gold and white and blue! — 
Month a man kin railly love — 
June, you know, I'm talkin' of! 

March ain't never nothin' new! — 
April's altogether too 
   Brash fer me! and May — I jes' 
   'Bominate its promises, — 
Little hints o' sunshine and 
Green around the timber-land — 
   A few blossoms, and a few 
   Chip-birds, and a sprout er two, — 
   Drap asleep, and it turns in 
   Fore daylight and snows ag'in! — 
But when June comes - Clear my th'oat 
   With wild honey! — Rench my hair 
In the dew! And hold my coat! 
Whoop out loud! And th'ow my hat! — 
   June wants me, and I'm to spare! 
   Spread them shadders anywhere, 
   I'll get down and waller there, 
      And obleeged to you at that!

Stasis in darkness.
Then the substanceless blue
Pour of tor and distances.

God's lioness,
How one we grow,
Pivot of heels and knees! —-The furrow

Splits and passes, sister to
The brown arc
Of the neck I cannot catch,

Nigger-eye
Berries cast dark
Hooks —-

Black sweet blood mouthfuls,
Shadows.
Something else

Hauls me through air —-
Thighs, hair;
Flakes from my heels.

White
Godiva, I unpeel —-
Dead hands, dead stringencies.

And now I
Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.
The child's cry

Melts in the wall.
And I
Am the arrow,

The dew that flies,
Suicidal, at one with the drive
Into the red

Eye, the cauldron of morning.

    <Story nr="224" title="Five Bells"> 

Time that is moved by little fidget wheels
Is not my time, the flood that does not flow.
Between the double and the single bell
Of a ship's hour, between a round of bells
From the dark warship riding there below,
I have lived many lives, and this one life
Of Joe, long dead, who lives between five bells.

Deep and dissolving verticals of light
Ferry the falls of moonshine down. Five bells
Coldly rung out in a machine's voice. Night and water
Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats
In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water.

Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve
These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought
Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth,
Gone even from the meaning of a name;
Yet something's there, yet something forms its lips
And hits and cries against the ports of space,
Beating their sides to make its fury heard.

Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face
In agonies of speech on speechless panes?
Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name!

But I hear nothing, nothing…only bells,
Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time.
Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life,
There's not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait —
Nothing except the memory of some bones
Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud;
And unimportant things you might have done,
Or once I thought you did; but you forgot,
And all have now forgotten — looks and words
And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off,
Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales
Of Irish kings and English perfidy,
And dirtier perfidy of publicans
Groaning to God from Darlinghurst.
Five bells.

Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder
Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain
The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark,
So dark you bore no body, had no face,
But a sheer voice that rattled out of air
(As now you'd cry if I could break the glass),
A voice that spoke beside me in the bush,
Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind,
Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man,
And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls
Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls
Are white and angry-tongued, or so you'd found.
But all I heard was words that didn't join
So Milton became melons, melons girls,
And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night,
And in each tree an Ear was bending down,
Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass,
When blank and bone-white, like a maniac's thought,
The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky,
Knifing the dark with deathly photographs.
There's not so many with so poor a purse
Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that,
Five miles in darkness on a country track,
But when you do, that's what you think.
Five bells.

In Melbourne, your appetite had gone,
Your angers too; they had been leeched away
By the soft archery of summer rains
And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp
That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind,
And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage,
The sodden ecstasies of rectitude.
I thought of what you'd written in faint ink,
Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind
With other things you left, all without use,
All without meaning now, except a sign
That someone had been living who now was dead:
"At Labassa. Room 6 x 8
On top of the tower; because of this, very dark
And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed
Into this room — 500 books all shapes
And colours, dealt across the floor
And over sills and on the laps of chairs;
Guns, photos of many different things
And differant curios that I obtained…"

In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare
Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper,
We argued about blowing up the world,
But you were living backward, so each night
You crept a moment closer to the breast,
And they were living, all of them, those frames
And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth,
And most your father, the old man gone blind,
With fingers always round a fiddle's neck,
That graveyard mason whose fair monuments
And tablets cut with dreams of piety
Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men
Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment
At cargoes they had never thought to bear,
These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone.

Where have you gone? The tide is over you,
The turn of midnight water's over you,
As Time is over you, and mystery,
And memory, the flood that does not flow.
You have no suburb, like those easier dead
In private berths of dissolution laid —
The tide goes over, the waves ride over you
And let their shadows down like shining hair,
But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend
Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed;
And you are only part of an Idea.
I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in,
The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack,
And the short agony, the longer dream,
The Nothing that was neither long nor short;
But I was bound, and could not go that way,
But I was blind, and could not feel your hand.
If I could find an answer, could only find
Your meaning, or could say why you were here
Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath
Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice?

I looked out my window in the dark
At waves with diamond quills and combs of light
That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand
In the moon's drench, that straight enormous glaze,
And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys
Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each,
And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard
Was a boat's whistle, and the scraping squeal
Of seabirds' voices far away, and bells,
Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out.
Five bells.On board ship a day is divided up into work periods known as watches. There are 5 four hour watches and 2 dog watches of 2 hours each.
Each watch is divided into eight (or 4) sections indicated by the ringing of bells. 8 bells is the beginning and the end of a particular watch.
Five bells is in the middle of a work period and corresponds to one of these times, 0230, 0630, 1030, 1430, 2230.
1830 ia not 5 bells on the 5th watch but one bell on the second dogwatch.

Birds singing
 in the dark
—Rainy dawn.

    <Story nr="226" title="The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam"> 

I.
Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. 

II.
Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky
I heard a voice within the Tavern cry,
"Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup
Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry." 

III.
And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before
The Tavern shouted — "Open then the Door!
You know how little while we have to stay,
And, once departed, may return no more." 

IV.
Now the New Year reviving old Desires,
The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,
Where the White Hand of Moses on the Bough
Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. 

V.
Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,
And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows;
But still the Vine her ancient ruby yields,
And still a Garden by the Water blows. 

VI.
And David's Lips are lock't; but in divine
High piping Pehlevi, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!
Red Wine!" — the Nightingale cries to the Rose
That yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine. 

VII.
Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring
The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:
The Bird of Time has but a little way
To fly — and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing. 

VIII.
Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,
Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,
The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,
The Leaves of Life kep falling one by one. 

IX.
Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say;
Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?
And this first Summer month that brings the Rose
Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away. 

X.
But come with old Khayyam, and leave the Lot
Of Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:
Let Rustum lay about him as he will,
Or Hatim Tai cry Supper — heed them not. 

XI.
With me along the strip of Herbage strown
That just divides the desert from the sown,
Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot —
And Peace is Mahmud on his Golden Throne! 

XII.
A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, — and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness —
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! 

XIII.
Some for the Glories of This World; and some
Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come;
Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,
Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! 

XIV.
Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spin
The Thread of present Life away to win —
What? for ourselves, who know not if we shall
Breathe out the very Breath we now breathe in! 

XV.
Look to the Rose that blows about us — "Lo,
Laughing," she says, "into the World I blow:
At once the silken Tassel of my Purse
Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw." 

XVI.
The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon
Turns Ashes — or it prospers; and anon,
Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face
Lighting a little Hour or two — is gone. 

XVII.
And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,
And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,
Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'd
As, buried once, Men want dug up again. 

XVIII.
Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai
Whose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,
How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp
Abode his Hour or two and went his way. 

XIX.
They say the Lion and the Lizard keep
The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:
And Bahram, that great Hunter — the Wild Ass
Stamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep. 

XX.
I sometimes think that never blows so red
The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;
That every Hyacinth the Garden wears
Dropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head. 

XXI.
And this delightful Herb whose tender Green
Fledges the River's Lip on which we lean —
Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows
From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen! 

XXII.
Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clears
To-day of past Regrets and future Fears —
To-morrow? — Why, To-morrow I may be
Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years. 

XXIII.
Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and best
That Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,
Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,
And one by one crept silently to Rest. 

XXIV.
And we, that now make merry in the Room
They left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,
Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth
Descend, ourselves to make a Couch — for whom? 

XXV.
Ah, make the most of what we may yet spend,
Before we too into the Dust descend;
Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie;
Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and — sans End! 

XXVI.
Alike for those who for To-day prepare,
And those that after some To-morrow stare,
A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries
"Fools! Your Reward is neither Here nor There!" 

XXVII.
Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd
Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrust
Like foolish Prophets forth; their Works to Scorn
Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust. 

XXVIII.
Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the Wise
To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;
One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown forever dies. 

XXIX.
Myself when young did eagerly frequent
Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
About it and about; but evermore
Came out by the same Door as in I went. 

XXX.
With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,
And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:
And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd —
"I came like Water and like Wind I go." 

XXXI.
Into this Universe, and Why not knowing,
Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:
And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,
I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. 

XXXII.
Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh Gate
I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,
And many Knots unravel'd by the Road;
But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate. 

XXXIII.
There was the Door to which I found no Key:
There was the Veil through which I could not see:
Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee
There was — and then no more of Thee and Me. 

XXXIV.
Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,
Asking, "What Lamp had Destiny to guide
Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?"
And — "A blind Understanding!" Heav'n replied. 

XXXV.
Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn
I lean'd, the secret Well of Life to learn:
And Lip to Lip it murmur'd — "While you live,
Drink! — for, once dead, you never shall return." 

XXXVI.
I think the Vessel, that with fugitive
Articulation answer'd, once did live,
And merry-make, and the cold Lip I kiss'd,
How many Kisses might it take — and give! 

XXXVII.
For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,
I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:
And with its all obliterated Tongue
It murmur'd — "Gently, Brother, gently, pray!" 

XXXVIII.
And has not such a Story from of Old
Down Man's successive generations roll'd
Of such a clod of saturated Earth
Cast by the Maker into Human mould? 

XXXIX.
Ah, fill the Cup: — what boots it to repeat
How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:
Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,
Why fret about them if To-day be sweet! 

XL.
A Moment's Halt — a momentary taste
Of Being from the Well amid the Waste —
And Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'd
The Nothing it set out from — Oh, make haste! 

XLI.
Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,
To-morrow's tangle to itself resign,
And lose your fingers in the tresses of
The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine. 

XLII.
Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit
Of This and That endeavor and dispute;
Better be merry with the fruitful Grape
Than sadden after none, or bitter, fruit. 

XLIII.
You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse
I made a Second Marriage in my house;
Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,
And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. 

XLIV.
And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,
Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel Shape
Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and
He bid me taste of it; and 'twas — the Grape! 

XLV.
The Grape that can with Logic absolute
The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:
The subtle Alchemest that in a Trice
Life's leaden Metal into Gold transmute. 

XLVI.
Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare
Blaspheme the twisted tendril as Snare?
A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?
And if a Curse — why, then, Who set it there? 

XLVII.
But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with me
The Quarrel of the Universe let be:
And, in some corner of the Hubbub couch'd,
Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee. 

XLVIII.
For in and out, above, about, below,
'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,
Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,
Round which we Phantom Figures come and go. 

XLIX.
Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who
Before us pass'd the door of Darkness through
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too. 

L.
The Revelations of Devout and Learn'd
Who rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,
Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep,
They told their fellows, and to Sleep return'd. 

LI.
Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,
And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,
Is't not a shame — Is't not a shame for him
So long in this Clay suburb to abide? 

LII.
But that is but a Tent wherein may rest
A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;
The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash
Strikes, and prepares it for another guest. 

LIII.
I sent my Soul through the Invisible,
Some letter of that After-life to spell:
And after many days my Soul return'd
And said, "Behold, Myself am Heav'n and Hell." 

LIV.
Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,
And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,
Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,
So late emerg'd from, shall so soon expire. 

LV.
While the Rose blows along the River Brink,
With old Khayyam and ruby vintage drink:
And when the Angel with his darker Draught
Draws up to Thee — take that, and do not shrink. 

LVI.
And fear not lest Existence closing your
Account, should lose, or know the type no more;
The Eternal Saki from the Bowl has pour'd
Millions of Bubbls like us, and will pour. 

LVII.
When You and I behind the Veil are past,
Oh but the long long while the World shall last,
Which of our Coming and Departure heeds
As much as Ocean of a pebble-cast. 

LVIII.
'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days
Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:
Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,
And one by one back in the Closet lays. 

LIX.
The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,
But Right or Left, as strikes the Player goes;
And he that toss'd Thee down into the Field,
He knows about it all — He knows — HE knows! 

LX.
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. 

LXI.
For let Philosopher and Doctor preach
Of what they will, and what they will not — each
Is but one Link in an eternal Chain
That none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach. 

LXII.
And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,
Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,
Lift not thy hands to it for help — for It
Rolls impotently on as Thou or I. 

LXIII.
With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,
And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:
Yea, the first Morning of Creation wrote
What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. 

LXIV.
Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:
Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:
Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. 

LXV.
I tell You this — When, starting from the Goal,
Over the shoulders of the flaming Foal
Of Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,
In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul. 

LXVI.
The Vine has struck a fiber: which about
If clings my Being — let the Dervish flout;
Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,
That shall unlock the Door he howls without. 

LXVII.
And this I know: whether the one True Light,
Kindle to Love, or Wrath — consume me quite,
One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caught
Better than in the Temple lost outright. 

LXVIII.
What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke
A conscious Something to resent the yoke
Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain
Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke! 

LXIX.
What! from his helpless Creature be repaid
Pure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay'd —
Sue for a Debt we never did contract,
And cannot answer — Oh the sorry trade! 

LXX.
Nay, but for terror of his wrathful Face,
I swear I will not call Injustice Grace;
Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern but
Would kick so poor a Coward from the place. 

LXXI.
Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin
Beset the Road I was to wander in,
Thou will not with Predestin'd Evil round
Enmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin? 

LXXII.
Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,
And who with Eden didst devise the Snake;
For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man
Is blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give — and take! 

LXXIII.
Listen again. One Evening at the Close
Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,
In that old Potter's Shop I stood alone
With the clay Population round in Rows. 

LXXIV.
And, strange to tell, among that Earthen Lot
Some could articulate, while others not:
And suddenly one more impatient cried —
"Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?" 

LXXV.
Then said another — "Surely not in vain
My Substance from the common Earth was ta'en,
That He who subtly wrought me into Shape
Should stamp me back to common Earth again." 

LXXVI.
Another said — "Why, ne'er a peevish Boy,
Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy;
Shall He that made the vessel in pure Love
And Fancy, in an after Rage destroy?" 

LXXVII.
None answer'd this; but after Silence spake
A Vessel of a more ungainly Make:
"They sneer at me for leaning all awry;
What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?" 

LXXVIII:
"Why," said another, "Some there are who tell
Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell
The luckless Pots he marred in making — Pish!
He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well." 

LXXIX.
Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,
"My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:
But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,
Methinks I might recover by-and-by!" 

LXXX.
So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,
The Little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:
And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!
Now for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking!" 

LXXXI.
Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,
And wash my Body whence the Life has died,
And in a Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,
So bury me by some sweet Garden-side. 

LXXXII.
That ev'n my buried Ashes such a Snare
Of Perfume shall fling up into the Air,
As not a True Believer passing by
But shall be overtaken unaware. 

LXXXIII.
Indeed the Idols I have loved so long
Have done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:
Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,
And sold my Reputation for a Song. 

LXXXIV.
Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before
I swore — but was I sober when I swore?
And then, and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand
My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. 

LXXXV.
And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,
And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor — well,
I often wonder what the Vintners buy
One half so precious as the Goods they sell. 

LXXXVI.
Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!
That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close!
The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,
Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! 

LXXXVII.
Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield
One glimpse — If dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd
To which the fainting Traveller might spring,
As springs the trampled herbage of the field! 

LXXXVIII.
Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits — and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! 

LXXXIX.
Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,
The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:
How oft hereafter rising shall she look
Through this same Garden after me — in vain! 

XC.
And when like her, oh Saki, you shall pass
Among the Guests star-scatter'd on the Grass,
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
Where I made one — turn down an empty Glass!

In my dream, 
drilling into the marrow 
of my entire bone, 
my real dream, 
I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill 
searching for a street sign — 
namely MERCY STREET. 
Not there. 

I try the Back Bay. 
Not there. 
Not there. 
And yet I know the number. 
45 Mercy Street. 
I know the stained-glass window 
of the foyer, 
the three flights of the house 
with its parquet floors. 
I know the furniture and 
mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, 
the servants. 
I know the cupboard of Spode 
the boat of ice, solid silver, 
where the butter sits in neat squares 
like strange giant's teeth 
on the big mahogany table. 
I know it well. 
Not there. 

Where did you go? 
45 Mercy Street, 
with great-grandmother 
kneeling in her whale-bone corset 
and praying gently but fiercely 
to the wash basin, 
at five A.M. 
at noon 
dozing in her wiggy rocker, 
grandfather taking a nap in the pantry, 
grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid, 
and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower 
on her forehead to cover the curl 
of when she was good and when she was… 
And where she was begat 
and in a generation 
the third she will beget, 
me, 
with the stranger's seed blooming 
into the flower called Horrid. 

I walk in a yellow dress 
and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes, 
enough pills, my wallet, my keys, 
and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five? 
I walk. I walk. 
I hold matches at street signs 
for it is dark, 
as dark as the leathery dead 
and I have lost my green Ford, 
my house in the suburbs, 
two little kids 
sucked up like pollen by the bee in me 
and a husband 
who has wiped off his eyes 
in order not to see my inside out 
and I am walking and looking 
and this is no dream 
just my oily life 
where the people are alibis 
and the street is unfindable for an 
entire lifetime. 

Pull the shades down — 
I don't care! 
Bolt the door, mercy, 
erase the number, 
rip down the street sign, 
what can it matter, 
what can it matter to this cheapskate 
who wants to own the past 
that went out on a dead ship 
and left me only with paper? 

Not there. 

I open my pocketbook, 
as women do, 
and fish swim back and forth 
between the dollars and the lipstick. 
I pick them out, 
one by one 
and throw them at the street signs, 
and shoot my pocketbook 
into the Charles River. 
Next I pull the dream off 
and slam into the cement wall 
of the clumsy calendar 
I live in, 
my life, 
and its hauled up 
notebooks.

Rise, brothers, rise; the wakening skies pray to the morning light, 
The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn like a child that has cried all night. 
Come, let us gather our nets from the shore and set our catamarans free, 
To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for we are the kings of the sea! 

No longer delay, let us hasten away in the track of the seagull's call, 
The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother, the waves are our comrades all. 
What though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives? 
He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives. 

Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove, 
And sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; 
But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; 
Row, brothers, row to the edge of the verge, where the low sky mates with the sea.

By white night-gowns.
None are green,

None of them are strange,
With socks of lace

To dream of baboons and periwinkles.
Only, here and there, an old sailor,
Drunk and asleep in his boots,
Catches Tigers
In red weather.

Some one came knocking
At my wee, small door;
Someone came knocking;

I looked to left and right,
But nought there was a stirring
In the still dark night;
Only the busy beetle
Tap-tapping in the wall,
Only from the forest
The screech-owl's call,
Only the cricket whistling
While the dewdrops fall,
So I know not who came knocking,
At all, at all, at all.

    <Story nr="232" title="Casey at the Bat"> 

The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day; 
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, "If only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat."
But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.

But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.

And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
"That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one!" the umpire said.

From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;
"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted some one on the stand;
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.

With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two!"

"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered "Fraud!"
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.

The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.

Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout;
But there is no joy in Mudville—great Casey has struck out.Composition date - 1888 -

When you're up against a trouble,
Meet it squarely, face to face;
Lift your chin and set your shoulders,
Plant your feet and take a brace.
When it's vain to try to dodge it,
Do the best that you can do;
You may fail, but you may conquer,
See it through !

Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim,
But don't let your nerve desert you;
Keep yourself in fighting trim.
If the worst is bound to happen,
Spite of all that you can do,
Running from it will not save you,
See it through !

Even hope may seem but futile,
When with troubles you’re beset,
But remember you are facing
Just what other men have met.
You may fail, but fall still fighting;
Don't give up, whate'er you do;
Eyes front, head high to the finish.

Life is a hospital where every patient is obsessed by the desire of changing beds. One would like to suffer opposite the stove, another is sure he would get well beside the window.

It always seems to me that I should be happy anywhere but where I am, and this question of moving is one that I am eternally discussing with my soul.

"Tell my, my soul, poor chilly soul, how would you like to live in Lisbon? It must be warm there, and you would be as blissful as a lizard in the sun. It is a city by the sea; they say that it is built of marble, and that its inhabitants have such a horror of the vegetable kingdom that they tear up all the trees. You see it is a country after my own heart; a country entirely made of mineral and light, and with liquid to reflect them."

My soul does not reply.

"Since you are so fond of being motionless and watching the pageantry of movement, would you like to live in the beatific land of Holland? Perhaps you could enjoy yourself in that country which you have so long admired in paintings on museum walls. What do you say to Rotterdam, you who love forests of masts, and ships that are moored on the doorsteps of houses?"

My soul remains silent.

"Perhaps you would like Batavia better? There, moreover, we should find the wit of Europe wedded to the beauty of the tropics."

Not a word. Can my soul be dead?

"Have you sunk into so deep a stupor that you are happy only in your unhappiness? If that is the case, let us fly to countries that are the counterfeits of Death. I know just the place for us, poor soul. We will pack up our trunks for Torneo. We will go still farther, to the farthest end of the Baltic Sea; still farther from life if possible; we will settle at the Pole. There the sun only obliquely grazes the earth, and the slow alternations of daylight and night abolish variety and increase that other half of nothingness, monotony. There we can take deep baths of darkness, while sometimes for our entertainment, the Aurora Borealis will shoot up its rose-red sheafs like the reflections of the fireworks of hell!"

At last my soul explodes! "Anywhere! Just so it is out of the world!"

   Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,

   Giving me strength erect against her hate.
   Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
   Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state,
   I stand within her walls with not a shred
  Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.

Corinna, Pride of Drury-Lane,
For whom no Shepherd sighs in vain;
Never did Covent Garden boast
So bright a batter'd, strolling Toast;
No drunken Rake to pick her up,
No Cellar where on Tick to sup;
Returning at the Midnight Hour;
Four Stories climbing to her Bow'r;
Then, seated on a three-legg'd Chair,
Takes off her artificial Hair:     
Now, picking out a Crystal Eye,
She wipes it clean, and lays it by.
Her Eye-Brows from a Mouse's Hide,
Stuck on with Art on either Side,
Pulls off with Care, and first displays 'em, 
Then in a Play-Book smoothly lays 'em.
Now dextrously her Plumpers draws,
That serve to fill her hollow Jaws.
Untwists a Wire; and from her Gums
A Set of Teeth completely comes.
Pulls out the Rags contriv'd to prop
Her flabby Dugs and down they drop.
Proceeding on, the lovely Goddess
Unlaces next her Steel-Rib'd Bodice;
Which by the Operator's Skill,     
Press down the Lumps, the Hollows fill,
Up hoes her Hand, and off she slips
The Bolsters that supply her Hips.
With gentlest Touch, she next explores
Her Shankers, Issues, running Sores,
Effects of many a sad Disaster;
And then to each applies a Plaster.
But must, before she goes to Bed,
Rub off the Daubs of White and Red;
And smooth the Furrows in her Front,
With greasy Paper stuck upon't.
She takes a Bolus e'er she sleeps;
And then between two Blankets creeps.
With pains of love tormented lies;
Or if she chance to close her Eyes,
Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams,
And feels the Lash, and faintly screams;
Or, by a faithless Bully drawn,
At some Hedge-Tavern lies in Pawn;
Or to Jamaica seems transported,
Alone, and by no Planter courted;
Or, near Fleet-Ditch's oozy Brinks,
Surrounded with a Hundred Stinks,
Belated, seems on watch to lie,
And snap some Cull passing by;
Or, struck with Fear, her Fancy runs
On Watchmen, Constables and Duns,
From whom she meets with frequent Rubs;
But, never from Religious Clubs;
Whose Favour she is sure to find,
Because she pays them all in Kind.
CORINNA wakes. A dreadful Sight!
Behold the Ruins of the Night!
A wicked Rat her Plaster stole,
Half eat, and dragged it to his Hole.
The Crystal Eye, alas, was miss'd;
And Puss had on her Plumpers piss'd.
A Pigeon pick'd her Issue-Peas;
And Shock her Tresses fill'd with Fleas.
The Nymph, tho' in this mangled Plight,
Must ev'ry Morn her Limbs unite.
But how shall I describe her Arts
To recollect the scatter'd Parts?
Or show the Anguish, Toil, and Pain,
Of gath'ring up herself again?     
The bashful Muse will never bear
In such a Scene to interfere.
Corinna in the Morning dizen'd,
Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.

I knew a woman, lovely in her bones,
When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;
Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:
The shapes a bright container can contain!
Of her choice virtues only gods should speak,
Or English poets who grew up on Greek
(I'd have them sing in a chorus, cheek to cheek).

How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,
She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand;
She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin;
I nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;
She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,
Coming behind her for her pretty sake
(But what prodigious mowing we did make).

Love likes a gander, and adores a goose:
Her full lips pursed, the errant notes to seize;
She played it quick, she played it light and loose;
My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;
Her several parts could keep a pure repose,
Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose
(She moved in circles, and those circles moved).

Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:
I'm martyr to a motion not my own;
What's freedom for? To know eternity.
I swear she cast a shadow white as stone.
But who would count eternity in days?
These old bones live to learn her wanton ways:

    But those were in the early glow
    Of feelings since subdued by care
    And they have died so long ago
    I hardly now believe they were

    First melted off the hope of youth
    Then Fancy's rainbow fast withdrew

Look down, and swear by the slain of the War that you'll never forget.

Do you remember the dark months you held the sector at Mametz—
The nights you watched and wired and dug and piled sandbags on parapets?
Do you remember the rats; and the stench
Of corpses rotting in front of the front-line trench—
And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill with a hopeless rain?
Do you ever stop and ask, 'Is it all going to happen again?'

Do you remember that hour of din before the attack—
And the anger, the blind compassion that seized and shook you then
As you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men?
Do you remember the stretcher-cases lurching back
With dying eyes and lolling heads—those ashen-grey
Masks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay?

Of being king and government and nation.
A road, a mile of kingdom, I am king
Of banks and stones and every blooming thing."Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight
Of being king and government and nation."

    <Story nr="245" title="After All"> 

The brooding ghosts of Australian night have gone from the bush and town; 
My spirit revives in the morning breeze, 
  though it died when the sun went down; 
The river is high and the stream is strong, 
  and the grass is green and tall, 
And I fain would think that this world of ours is a good world after all. 

The light of passion in dreamy eyes, and a page of truth well read, 
The glorious thrill in a heart grown cold of the spirit I thought was dead, 
A song that goes to a comrade's heart, and a tear of pride let fall — 
And my soul is strong! and the world to me is a grand world after all! 

Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks, 
  and theirs be the fault or shame 
(The man is bitter against the world who has only himself to blame); 
Let the darkest side of the past be dark, and only the good recall; 
For I must believe that the world, my dear, is a kind world after all. 

It well may be that I saw too plain, and it may be I was blind; 
But I'll keep my face to the dawning light, 
  though the devil may stand behind! 
Though the devil may stand behind my back, I'll not see his shadow fall, 
But read the signs in the morning stars of a good world after all. 

Rest, for your eyes are weary, girl — you have driven the worst away — 
The ghost of the man that I might have been is gone from my heart to-day; 
We'll live for life and the best it brings till our twilight shadows fall; 
My heart grows brave, and the world, my girl, is a good world after all.

    <Story nr="247" title="Knocked Up"> 

I'm lyin' on the barren ground that's baked and cracked with drought, 
And dunno if my legs or back or heart is most wore out; 
I've got no spirits left to rise and smooth me achin' brow — 
I'm too knocked up to light a fire and bile the billy now. 

     Oh it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin', in flies an' dust an' heat, 
     Or it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-a-mpin' 
       through mud and slush 'n sleet; 
     It's tramp an' tramp for tucker — one everlastin' strife, 
     An' wearin' out yer boots an' heart in the wastin' of yer life. 

They whine o' lost an' wasted lives in idleness and crime — 
I've wasted mine for twenty years, and grafted all the time 
And never drunk the stuff I earned, nor gambled when I shore — 
But somehow when yer on the track yer life seems wasted more. 

A long dry stretch of thirty miles I've tramped this broilin' day, 
All for the off-chance of a job a hundred miles away; 
There's twenty hungry beggars wild for any job this year, 
An' fifty might be at the shed while I am lyin' here. 

The sinews in my legs seem drawn, red-hot — 'n that's the truth; 
I seem to weigh a ton, and ache like one tremendous tooth; 
I'm stung between my shoulder-blades — my blessed back seems broke; 
I'm too knocked out to eat a bite — I'm too knocked up to smoke. 

The blessed rain is comin' too — there's oceans in the sky, 
An' I suppose I must get up and rig the blessed fly; 
The heat is bad, the water's bad, the flies a crimson curse, 
The grub is bad, mosquitoes damned — but rheumatism's worse. 

I wonder why poor blokes like me will stick so fast ter breath, 
Though Shakespeare says it is the fear of somethin' after death; 
But though Eternity be cursed with God's almighty curse — 
What ever that same somethin' is I swear it can't be worse. 

     For it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin' thro' hell across the plain, 
     And it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-mpin' thro' slush 'n mud 'n rain — 
     A livin' worse than any dog — without a home 'n wife, 
     A-wearin' out yer heart 'n soul in the wastin' of yer life.

Did the people of Viet Nam
use lanterns of stone?
Did they hold ceremonies
to reverence the opening of buds?
Were they inclined to quiet laughter?
Did they use bone and ivory,
jade and silver, for ornament?
Had they an epic poem?
Did they distinguish between speech and singing?

Sir, their light hearts turned to stone.
It is not remembered whether in gardens
stone gardens illumined pleasant ways.
Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,
but after their children were killed
there were no more buds.
Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.
A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.
All the bones were charred.
it is not remembered. Remember,
most were peasants; their life
was in rice and bamboo.
When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddies
and the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,
maybe fathers told their sons old tales.
When bombs smashed those mirrors
there was time only to scream.
There is an echo yet
of their speech which was like a song.
It was reported their singing resembled 
the flight of moths in moonlight.
Who can say? It is silent now.

    <Story nr="249" title="A Ballad of Dreamland"> 

I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;
In a softer bed then the soft white snow's is,
Under the roses I hid my heart.
Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
Only the song of a secret bird.

Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,
And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;
Lie still, for the wind on the warm seas dozes,
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart?
Only the song of a secret bird.

The green land's name that a charm encloses, 
It never was writ in the traveller's chart,
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,
It never was sold in the merchant's mart.
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;
No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,
Only the song of a secret bird.


ENVOI

In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true love's truth or of light love's art,
Only the song of a secret bird.

A poem should be palpable and mute
 As a globed fruit

 Dumb
 As old medallions to the thumb

 Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
 Of casement ledges where the moss has grown -

 A poem should be wordless
 As the flight of birds

 A poem should be motionless in time
 As the moon climbs

 Leaving, as the moon releases
 Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,

 Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,
 Memory by memory the mind -

 A poem should be motionless in time
 As the moon climbs

 A poem should be equal to:
 Not true

 For all the history of grief
 An empty doorway and a maple leaf

 For love
 The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea -

Of joys seems—not to suffer pain?

The world is charged with the grandeur of God.
     It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;

Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
     And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
     And wears man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;
     There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went
     Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs—
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
     World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

    <Story nr="254" title="Secret Love"> 

Not one kind look….one friendly word!
Wilt thou in chilling silence sit;
Nor through the social hour afford
One cheering smile, or beam of wit?

Yet still, absorbed in studious care,
Neglect to waste one look on me;
For then my happy eyes may dare
To gaze and dwell unchecked on thee.

And still in silence sit, nor deign
One gentle precious word to say;
For silent I may then remain,
Nor let my voice my soul betray.

This faltering voice, these conscious eyes,
My throbbing heart too plainly speak:
There timid hopeless passion lies,
And bids it silence keep, and break .

To me how dear this twilight hour,
Cheered by the faggot's varying blaze!
If this be mine, I ask no more
On morn's refulgent light to gaze:

For now, while on HIS glowing cheek
I see the fire's red radiance fall,
The darkest seat I softly seek,
And gaze on HIM , unseen by all.

His folded arms, his studious brow,
His thoughtful eye, unmarked, I see;
Nor could his voice or words bestow
So dear, so true a joy on me.

But he forgets that I am near….
Fame, future fame, in thought he seeks:
To him ambition's paths appear,
And bright the sun of science breaks.

His heart with ardent hope is filled;
His prospects full of beauty bloom:
But, oh! my heart despair has chilled,
My only prospect is….the tomb!

One only boon from Heaven I claim,
And may it grant the fond desire!
That I may live to hear his fame,
And in that throb of joy expire .

Oft hast thou marked my chilling eye,
And mourned my cold reserve to see,
Resolved the fickle friend to fly,
Who seemed unjust to worth and thee:

While I, o'erjoyed, thy anger saw….
Blest proof I had not tried in vain
To give imperious passion law,
And hide my bosom's conscious pain.

But when night's sheltering darkness came,
And none the conscious wretch could view,
How fiercely burned the smothered flame!
How deep was every sigh I drew!

Yet still to thee I'll clothe my brow
In all that jealous pride requires;
My look the type of Ætna's snow….
My heart, of Ætna's secret fires.

One little moment, short as blest,
Compassion Love's soft semblance wore;
My meagre form he fondly pressed,
And on his beating bosom bore.

His frame with strong emotion shook,
And kindness tuned each faltering word;
While I, surprised, with anxious look
The meaning of his glance explored.

But soon my too experienced heart
Read nought but generous pity there;
I felt presumptuous hope depart,
And all again was dark despair.

Yet still, in memory still, my heart
Lives o'er that fleeting bliss again;
I feel his glance, his touch, impart
Emotion through each bursting vein.

And "Once ," I cry, "those eyes so sweet
On me with fondness deigned to shine;
For once I felt his bosom beat
Against the conscious throbs of mine!"

Nor shall the dear remembrance die
While aught of life to me is given;
But soothe my last convulsive sigh,
And be, till then, my joy….my heaven!

How pleasant to know Mr. Lear, 
Who has written such volumes of stuff. 
Some think him ill-tempered and queer, 
But a few find him pleasant enough. 

His mind is concrete and fastidious, 
His nose is remarkably big; 
His visage is more or less hideous, 
His beard it resembles a wig. 

He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers, 
(Leastways if you reckon two thumbs); 
He used to be one of the singers, 
But now he is one of the dumbs. 

He sits in a beautiful parlour, 
With hundreds of books on the wall; 
He drinks a great deal of marsala, 
But never gets tipsy at all. 

He has many friends, laymen and clerical, 
Old Foss is the name of his cat; 
His body is perfectly spherical, 
He weareth a runcible hat. 

When he walks in waterproof white, 
The children run after him so! 
Calling out, "He's gone out in his night- 
Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!" 

He weeps by the side of the ocean, 
He weeps on the top of the hill; 
He purchases pancakes and lotion, 
And chocolate shrimps from the mill. 

He reads, but he does not speak, Spanish, 
He cannot abide ginger beer; 
Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish, 
How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!

	No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,
	The Ship was still as she could be;
	Her sails from heaven received no motion,
	Her keel was steady in the ocean.
	Without either sign or sound of their shock,
	The waves flow’d over the Inchcape Rock;
	So little they rose, so little they fell,
	They did not move the Inchcape Bell.
	The worthy Abbot of Aberbrothok
	Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock;
	On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,
	And over the waves its warning rung.
	When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell,
	The Mariners heard the warning Bell;
	And then they knew the perilous Rock,
	And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok
	The Sun in the heaven was shining gay,
	All things were joyful on that day;
	The sea-birds scream’d as they wheel’d round,
	And there was joyaunce in their sound.
	The buoy of the Inchcpe Bell was seen
	A darker speck on the ocean green;
	Sir Ralph the Rover walk’d his deck,
	And fix’d his eye on the darker speck.
	He felt the cheering power of spring,
	It made him whistle, it made him sing;
	His heart was mirthful to excess,
	But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness.
	His eye was on the Inchcape Float;
	Quoth he, “My men, put out the boat,
	And row me to the Inchcape Rock,
	And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.”
	The boat is lower’d, the boatmen row,
	And to the Inchcape Rock they go;
	Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,
	And he cut the bell from the Inchcape Float.
	Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound,
	The bubbles rose and burst around;
	Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the Rock,
	Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.”
	Sir Ralph the Rover sail’d away,
	He scour’d the seas for many a day;
	And now grown rich with plunder’d store,
	He steers his course for Scotland’s shore.
	So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky,
	They cannot see the sun on high;
	The wind hath blown a gale all day,
	At evening it hath died away.
	On the deck the Rover takes his stand,
	So dark it is they see no land.
	Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon,
	For there is the dawn of the rising Moon.”
	“Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar?
	For methinks we should be near the shore.”
	“Now, where we are I cannot tell,
	But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell.”
	They hear no sound, the swell is strong,
	Though the wind hath fallen they drift along;
	Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,
	“Oh Christ! It is the Inchcape Rock!”
	Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,
	He curst himself in his despair;
	The waves rush in on every side,
	The ship is sinking beneath the tide.
	But even is his dying fear,
	One dreadful sound could the Rover hear;
	A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell,
	The Devil below was ringing his knell.

heart beat fast. If I meet 
you suddenly, I can't

speak — my tongue is broken; 
a thin flame runs under

trembling shakes my body

	We were twined together, joined lips forgot
	How the shadows fall when day is done,
	And when Love is not.
	We have made no vows - there will none be broke,
	Our love was free as the wind on the hill,
	There was no word said we need wish unspoke,
	We have wrought no ill.

Assist my labours, and my strains refine;
In smoothest numbers pour the notes along,
For bright Aurora now demands my song.

Which deck thy progress through the vaulted skies:
The morn awakes, and wide extends her rays,
On ev'ry leaf the gentle zephyr plays;
Harmonious lays the feather'd race resume,
Dart the bright eye, and shake the painted plume.
  Ye shady groves, your verdant gloom display
To shield your poet from the burning day:
Calliope awake the sacred lyre,
While thy fair sisters fan the pleasing fire:
The bow'rs, the gales, the variegated skies
In all their pleasures in my bosom rise.

Mountains and rivers, far from my old garden,

To him who in the love of nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.  When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart-
Go forth, under the open sky, and list
To nature's teachings, while from all around-
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air-
Comes a still voice-yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy images.  Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrending up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon.  The oak
Shall send his roots a broad, and pierce thy mold.

Yet not to thine eternal resting place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent.  Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world - with kings,
The powerful of the earth - the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulcher.  The hills
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun - the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods - rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,

Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste -
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man.  The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages.  All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom.  Take the wings
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings - yet the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep - the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny.  The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn broad of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee.  As the long train
Of ages glides away, the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man -
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those who in their turn shall follow them.

So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, which moves
To that mysterious realm where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

    <Story nr="265" title="A Familiar Letter"> 

YES, write, if you want to, there's nothing like trying;
     Who knows what a treasure your casket may hold?
     I'll show you that rhyming's as easy as lying,
     If you'll listen to me while the art I unfold.

     Here's a book full of words; one can choose as he fancies,
     As a painter his tint, as a workman his tool;
     Just think! all the poems and plays and romances
     Were drawn out of this, like the fish from a pool!

     You can wander at will through its syllabled mazes,
     And take all you want, not a copper they cost,—
     What is there to hinder your picking out phrases
     For an epic as clever as "Paradise Lost"?

     Don't mind if the index of sense is at zero,
     Use words that run smoothly, whatever they mean;
     Leander and Lilian and Lillibullero
     Are much the same thing in the rhyming machine.

     There are words so delicious their sweetness will smother
     That boarding-school flavor of which we're afraid,
     There is "lush"is a good one, and "swirl" is another,—
     Put both in one stanza, its fortune is made.

     With musical murmurs and rhythmical closes
     You can cheat us of smiles when you've nothing to tell
     You hand us a nosegay of milliner's roses, 
     And we cry with delight, "Oh, how sweet they do smell!"

     Perhaps you will answer all needful conditions
     For winning the laurels to which you aspire,
     By docking the tails of the two prepositions
     I' the style o' the bards you so greatly admire.

     As for subjects of verse, they are only too plenty
     For ringing the changes on metrical chimes;
     A maiden, a moonbeam, a lover of twenty 
     Have filled that great basket with bushels of rhymes.

     Let me show you a picture—'t is far from irrelevant—
     By a famous old hand in the arts of design;
     'T is only a photographed sketch of an elephant,—
     The name of the draughtsman was Rembrandt of Rhine.

     How easy! no troublesome colors to lay on,
     It can't have fatigued him,— no, not in the least,—
     A dash here and there with a haphazard crayon,
     And there stands the wrinkled-skinned, baggy-limbed beast.

     Just so with your verse,— 't is as easy as sketching,—
     You can reel off a song without knitting your brow,
     As lightly as Rembrandt a drawing or etching;
     It is nothing at all, if you only know how.

     Well; imagine you've printed your volume of verses:
     Your forehead is wreathed with the garland of fame,
     Your poems the eloquent school-boy rehearses,
     Her album the school-girl presents for your name;

     Each morning the post brings you autograph letters;
     You'll answer them promptly,— an hour isn't much
     For the honor of sharing a page with your betters,
     With magistrates, members of Congress, and such.

     Of course you're delighted to serve the committees
     That come with requests from the country all round,
     You would grace the occasion with poems and ditties
     When they've got a new schoolhouse, or poorhouse, or pound.

     With a hymn for the saints and a song for the sinners,
     You go and are welcome wherever you please;
     You're a privileged guest at all manner of dinners,
     You've a seat on the platform among the grandees.

     At length your mere presence becomes a sensation,
     Your cup of enjoyment is filled to its brim 
     With the pleasure Horatian of digitmonstration,
     As the whisper runs round of "That's he!" or "That's him!"

     But remember, O dealer in phrases sonorous,
     So daintily chosen, so tunefully matched,
     Though you soar with the wings of the cherubim o'er us,
     The ovum was human from which you were hatched.

     No will of your own with its puny compulsion
     Can summon the spirit that quickens the lyre;
     It comes, if at all, like the Sibyl's convulsion
     And touches the brain with a finger of fire.

     So perhaps, after all, it's as well to he quiet
     If you've nothing you think is worth saying in prose,
     As to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet
     To the critics, by publishing, as you propose.

     But it's all of no use, and I'm sorry I've written,—
     I shall see your thin volume some day on my shelf;
     For the rhyming tarantula surely has bitten,
     And music must cure you, so pipe it yourself.

    <Story nr="266" title="Alone, Looking For Blossoms Along The River"> 

The sorrow of riverside blossoms inexplicable,
And nowhere to complain — I've gone half crazy.
I look up our southern neighbor. But my friend in wine
Gone ten days drinking. I find only an empty bed.

A thick frenzy of blossoms shrouding the riverside,
I stroll, listing dangerously, in full fear of spring.
Poems, wine — even this profusely driven, I endure.
Arrangements for this old, white-haired man can wait.

A deep river, two or three houses in bamboo quiet,
And such goings on: red blossoms glaring with white!
Among spring's vociferous glories, I too have my place:
With a lovely wine, bidding life's affairs bon voyage.

Looking east to Shao, its smoke filled with blossoms,
I admire that stately Po-hua wineshop even more.
To empty golden wine cups, calling such beautiful
Dancing girls to embroidered mats — who could bear it?

East of the river, before Abbot Huang's grave, 
Spring is a frail splendor among gentle breezes.
In this crush of peach blossoms opening ownerless,
Shall I treasure light reds, or treasure them dark?

At Madame Huang's house, blossoms fill the paths:
Thousands, tens of thousands haul the branches down.
And butterflies linger playfully — an unbroken
Dance floating to songs orioles sing at their ease.

I don't so love blossoms I want to die. I'm afraid,
Once they are gone, of old age still more impetuous.
And they scatter gladly, by the branchful. Let's talk
Things over, little buds —-open delicately, sparingly.

    <Story nr="270" title="The Creation"> 

And God stepped out on space,
And He looked around and said,
"I'm lonely —
I'll make me a world."

And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.

Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said, "That's good!"

Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,
And God rolled the light around in His hands
Until He made the sun;
And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said, "That's good!"

Then God himself stepped down —
And the sun was on His right hand,
And the moon was on His left;
The stars were clustered about His head,
And the earth was under His feet.
And God walked, and where He trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.

Then He stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And He spat out the seven seas;
He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;
He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.

Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around His shoulder.

Then God raised His arm and He waved His hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And He said, "Bring forth! Bring forth!"
And quicker than God could drop His hand.
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said, "That's good!"

Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that He had made.
He looked at His sun,
And He looked at His moon,
And He looked at His little stars;
He looked on His world
With all its living things,
And God said, "I'm lonely still."

Then God sat down
On the side of a hill where He could think;
By a deep, wide river He sat down;
With His head in His hands,
God thought and thought,
Till He thought, "I'll make me a man!"

Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled Him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;
This Great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till He shaped it in His own image;

Then into it He blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen. Amen.

Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:

Arithmetic is where numbers fly like pigeons in and out of your

Arithmetic tells you how many you lose or win if you know how

Arithmetic is seven eleven all good children go to heaven — or five
    six bundle of sticks.
Arithmetic is numbers you squeeze from your head to your hand
    to your pencil to your paper till you get the answer.
Arithmetic is where the answer is right and everything is nice and
    you can look out of the window and see the blue sky — or the
    answer is wrong and you have to start all over and try again
    and see how it comes out this time.
If you take a number and double it and double it again and then
    double it a few more times, the number gets bigger and bigger
    and goes higher and higher and only arithmetic can tell you
    what the number is when you decide to quit doubling.
Arithmetic is where you have to multiply — and you carry the
    multiplication table in your head and hope you won't lose it.
If you have two animal crackers, one good and one bad, and you
    eat one and a striped zebra with streaks all over him eats the
    other, how many animal crackers will you have if somebody

    Nay nay nay and you say Nix nix nix?

I put on eyeliner and a concerto and make pungent observations about the great issues of the day

And because
When he is late for dinner and I know he must be either having an affair or lying dead in the middle of the street,
I always hope he's dead.

It's true love because
If he said quit drinking martinis but I kept drinking them and the next morning I couldn't get out of bed,
He wouldn't tell me he told me,
And because
He is willing to wear unironed undershorts
Out of respect for the fact that I am philosophically opposed to ironing,
And because
If his mother was drowning and I was drowning and he had to choose one of us to save,
He says he'd save me.

It's true love because
When he went to San Francisco on business while I had to stay home with the painters and the exterminator and the baby who was getting the chicken pox,
He understood why I hated him,
And because
When I said that playing the stock market was juvenile and irresponsible and then the stock I wouldn't let him buy went up twenty-six points,
I understood why he hated me,

    <Story nr="290" title="Five Ways to Kill a Man"> 

There are many cumbersome ways to kill a man.
You can make him carry a plank of wood
to the top of a hill and nail him to it. To do this
properly you require a crowd of people
wearing sandals, a cock that crows, a cloak
to dissect, a sponge, some vinegar and one
man to hammer the nails home.

Or you can take a length of steel,
shaped and chased in a traditional way,
and attempt to pierce the metal cage he wears.
But for this you need white horses,
English trees, men with bows and arrows,
at least two flags, a prince, and a
castle to hold your banquet in.

Dispensing with nobility, you may, if the wind
allows, blow gas at him. But then you need
a mile of mud sliced through with ditches,
not to mention black boots, bomb craters,
more mud, a plague of rats, a dozen songs
and some round hats made of steel.

In an age of aeroplanes, you may fly
miles above your victim and dispose of him by
pressing one small switch. All you then
require is an ocean to separate you, two
systems of government, a nation's scientists,
several factories, a psychopath and
land that no-one needs for several years.

These are, as I began, cumbersome ways
to kill a man. Simpler, direct, and much more neat
is to see that he is living somewhere in the middle
of the twentieth century, and leave him there.

     Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,    Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth    Upon the sides of mirth,    Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears    Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;    Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs    Upon the flesh to cleave,    Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,    And many sorrows after each his wise   For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.   O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,   Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;   O Love and Time and Sin,   Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,   Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;   O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine   Came softer with her praise;   Abide a little for our lady's love.   The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,   And more than peace the passage of her days.   O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.   O Time, thou shalt not find in any land   Till, cast out of thine hand,   The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,   Another woman fashioned like as this.   O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her   Was made a goodly thing;   Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,   With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier   Than lips of amorous roses in late spring.   By night there stood over against my bed   Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,   Both sides drawn fully back   From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,   And temples drained of purple and full of death.   Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water   And the sea's gold in it.   Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.   Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,   And pearl and purple and amber on her feet.   Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline   Were painted all the secret ways of love   And covered things thereof,   That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;   Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,   And brides that kept within the bride-chamber   Their garment of soft shame,   And weeping faces of the wearied loves   That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,   With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame.   The tears that through her eyelids fell on me   Made mine own bitter where they ran between   As blood had fallen therein,   She saying: Arise, lift up thine eyes and see   If any glad thing be or any good   Now the best thing is taken forth of us;   Even she to whom all praise   Was as one flower in a great multitude,   One glorious flower of many and glorious,    One day found gracious among many days:   Even she whose handmaiden was Love—to whom   At kissing times across her stateliest bed   Kings bowed themselves and shed   Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,   And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;   Even she between whose lips the kiss became   As fire and frankincense;   Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,   Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,   Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence.   Then I beheld, and lo on the other side   My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.   Sweet still, but now not red,   Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.   And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,   The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.   And sweet, but like spoilt gold,   The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.   And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,   The body that was clothed with love of old.   Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair   And all the hollow bosom of her gown—   Ah! that my tears ran down   Even to the place where many kisses were,   Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,   Even where they are cloven apart—who knows not this?   Ah! the flowers cleave apart   And their sweet fills the tender interspace;   Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss   Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart.   Ah! in the days when God did good to me,   Each part about her was a righteous thing;   Her mouth an almsgiving,   The glory of her garments charity,   The beauty of her bosom a good deed,   In the good days when God kept sight of us;   Love lay upon her eyes,   And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;   And all her body was more virtuous  Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.  Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands  And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves  Rain-rotten in rank lands,  Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves  And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;  And when thy bosom is filled full thereof  Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,  And say "My master that was thrall to Love  Is become thrall to Death."  Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.  But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;  For haply it may be  That when thy feet return at evening  Death shall come in with thee.Credits and CopyrightTogether with the editors, the Department ofEnglish (University of Toronto), and the University of Toronto Press,the following individuals share copyright for the work that wentin

    <Story nr="292" title="A Farewell"> 

My fairest child, I have no song to give you;
No lark could pipe in skies so dull and gray;
Yet, if you will, one quiet hint I'll leave you,
For every day.

I'll tell you how to sing a clearer carol
Than lark who hails the dawn or breezy down
To earn yourself a purer poet's laurel
Than Shakespeare's crown.

Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever;
Do lovely things, not dream them, all day long;
And so make Life, and Death, and that For Ever,
One grand sweet song.

    <Story nr="293" title="Lord Ullin's Daughter"> 

A chieftain, to the Highlands bound, 
   Cries, "Boatman, do not tarry! 
And I'll give thee a silver pound, 
   To row us o'er the ferry."- 

"Now who be ye, would cross Lochgyle 
   This dark and stormy water?" 
"O, I'm the chief of Ulva's isle, 
   And this Lord Ullin's daughter.- 

And fast before her father's men 
   Three days we've fled together, 
For should he find us in the glen, 
   My blood would stain the heather. 

His horsemen hard behind us ride; 
   Should they our steps discover, 
Then who will cheer my bonny bride 
   When they have slain her lover?"- 

Out spoke the hardy Highland wight, 
   "I'll go, my cheif-I'm ready:- 
It is not for your silver bright; 
   But for your winsome lady: 

And by my word! the bonny bird 
   In danger shall not tarry: 
For though the waves are raging white, 
   I'll row you o'er the ferry."- 

By this the storm grew loud apace, 
   The water-wraith was shrieking; 
And in the scowl of heaven each face 
   Grew dark as they were speaking. 

But still wilder blew the wind, 
   And as the night grew drearer, 
Adown the glen rode armed men, 
   Their trampling sounded nearer. 

"Oh haste thee, haste!" the lady cries 
   "Though tempest round us gather; 
I'll meet the raging of the skies, 
   But not an angry father."- 

The boat had left a stormy land, 
   A stormy sea before her,- 
When, oh! too strong for human hand, 
   The waters gathered o'er her.- 

And still they rowed amidst the roar 
   Of waters fast prevailing: 
Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore, 
   His wrath was changed to wailing:- 

For sore dismayed, through storm and shade, 
   His child he did discover:- 
One lovely hand stretched out for aid, 
   And one was round her lover. 

"Come back! come back!" he cried in grief, 
   "Across this stormy water: 
And I'll forgive your Highland chief, 
   My daughter!-oh, my daughter!"- 

'Twas vain: the loud waves lashed the shore, 
   Return or aid preventing:- 
And the waters went wild o'er his child, 
   And he was left lamenting.

    <Story nr="294" title="Ode on Solitude"> 

Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound,
Content to breathe his native air,
                                In his own ground.

Whose heards with milk, whose fields with bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
                                In winter fire.

Blest! who can unconcern'dly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
In health of body, peace of mind,
                                Quiet by day,

Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Together mix'd; sweet recreation,
And innocence, which most does please,
                                With meditation.

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me die;
Steal from the world, and not a stone
                                Tell where I lye.

The old woman across the way
     is whipping the boy again
and shouting to the neighborhood
     her goodness and his wrongs.

Wildly he crashes through elephant ears,
     pleads in dusty zinnias,
while she in spite of crippling fat
     pursues and corners him.

She strikes and strikes the shrilly circling
     boy till the stick breaks
in her hand.  His tears are rainy weather
     to woundlike memories:

My head gripped in bony vise
     of knees, the writhing struggle
to wrench free, the blows, the fear
     worse than blows that hateful

Words could bring, the face that I
     no longer knew or loved . . .
Well, it is over now, it is over,
     and the boy sobs in his room,

And the woman leans muttering against
     a tree, exhausted, purged—
avenged in part for lifelong hidings
     she has had to bear.

    <Story nr="297" title="History Of The Night"> 

Throughout the course of the generations
men constructed the night.
At first she was blindness; 
thorns raking bare feet,
fear of wolves.
We shall never know who forged the word
for the interval of shadow 
dividing the two twilights;
we shall never know in what age it came to mean
the starry hours.
Others created the myth.
They made her the mother of the unruffled Fates
that spin our destiny,
they sacrificed black ewes to her, and the cock
who crows his own death. 
The Chaldeans assigned to her twelve houses;
to Zeno, infinite words.
She took shape from Latin hexameters
and the terror of Pascal.
Luis de Leon saw in her the homeland
of his stricken soul.
Now we feel her to be inexhaustible
like an ancient wine
and no one can gaze on her without vertigo
and time has charged her with eternity.


And to think that she wouldn't exist 
except for those fragile instruments, the eyes.

Did I not say to you, “Go not there, for I am your friend; in this 
mirage of annihilation I am the fountain of life?”
Even though in anger you depart a hundred thousand years
from me, in the end you will come to me, for I am your goal.
Did I not say to you, “Be not content with worldly forms, for I
am the fashioner of the tabernacle of your contentment?”
Did I not say to you, “I am the sea and you are a single fish;
go not to dry land, for I am your crystal sea?”
Did I not say to you, “ Go not like birds to the snare; come, for
I am the power of flight and your wings and feet?”
Did I not say to you, “ They will waylay you and make you
cold, for I am the fire and warmth and heat of your desire?”
Did I not say to you, “ They will implant in you ugly qualities
so that you will forget that I am the source of purity to you?”
Did I not say to you, “Do not say from what direction the ser-
vant’s affairs come into order?” I am the Creator without
directions.
If you are the lamp of the heart, know where the road is to the
house; and if you are godlike of attribute, know that I am your
Maser.215

The Mystical Poems of Rumi 2
Second Selection, Poems 201-400

Translation by A.J. Arberry

F 1725
According to Aflaki Sultan Rokn-al-din, Saljuqi was invited to Aq Sarai by his emirs to decide about the strategy to face the approaching Mongol horde. He consulted Mowlana, who said, "It is better not to go there." But Rokn-al-din went and was strangled by his own people. It is reported that before his death he shouted: "Mowlana, Mowlana!" Meanwhile Rumi was at Sema. He told the disciples of Rokn-al-din's death and composed this poem. Manaqeb 1: 147-8.

    <Story nr="299" title="On Growing Old"> 

Be with me, Beauty, for the fire is dying; 
My dog and I are old, too old for roving. 
Man, whose young passion sets the spindrift flying, 
Is soon too lame to march, too cold for loving. 
I take the book and gather to the fire, 
Turning old yellow leaves; minute by minute 
The clock ticks to my heart. A withered wire, 
Moves a thiun ghost of music in the spinet. 
I cannot sail your seas, I cannot wander 
Your cornland, nor your hill-land, nor your valleys 
Ever again, nore share the battle yonder 
Where the young knight the broken squadron rallies. 
Only stay quiet while my mind remembers 
The beauty of fire from the beauty of embers. 

Beauty, have pity! for the strong have power, 
The rich their wealth, the beautiful their grace, 
Summer of man its sunlight and its flower. 
Spring-time of man, all April in a face. 
Only, as in the jostling in the Strand, 
Where the mob thrusts, or loiters, or is loud, 
The beggar with the saucer in his hand 
Asks only a penny from the passing crowd, 
So, from this glittering world with all its fashion, 
Its fire, and play of men, its stir, its march, 
Let me have wisdom, Beauty, wisdom and passion, 
Bread to the soul, rain when the summers parch. 
Give me but these, and though the darkness close 
Even the night will blossom as the rose.

    <Story nr="300" title="To The Virgins: To Make Much Of Time"> 

Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,
          Old Time is still a flying:
     And this same flower that smiles today,
          Tomorrow will be dying.

     The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
          The higher he's a getting;
     The sooner will his race be run,
          And nearer he's to setting.

     That age is best, which is the first,
          When youth and blood are warmer;
     But being spent, the worse, and worst
          Times, still succeed the former.

     Then be not coy, but use your time;
          And while ye may, go marry:
     For having lost but once your prime,
          You may forever tarry.

    <Story nr="301" title="The Seed-Shop"> 

Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie, Faded as crumbled stone or shifting sand,Forlorn as ashes, shrivelled, scentless, dry - Meadows and gardens running through my hand. In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams; A cedar in this narrow cell is thrustThat will drink deeply of a century's streams; These lilies shall make summer on my dust. Here in their safe and simple house of death, Sealed in their shells, a million roses leap;Here I can blow a garden with my breath, And in my hand a forest lies asleep.

    <Story nr="302" title="The Old Flame"> 

My old flame, my wife!
Remember our lists of birds?
One morning last summer, I drove
by our house in Maine. It was still
on top of its hill -

Now a red ear of Indian maize
was splashed on the door.
Old Glory with thirteen stripes 
hung on a pole. The clapboard
was old-red schoolhouse red.

Inside, a new landlord,
a new wife, a new broom!
Atlantic seaboard antique shop
pewter and plunder
shone in each room.

A new frontier!
No running next door
now to phone the sheriff
for his taxi to Bath
and the State Liquor Store!

No one saw your ghostly 
imaginary lover
stare through the window
and tighten
the scarf at his throat.

Health to the new people,
health to their flag, to their old
restored house on the hill!
Everything had been swept bare,
furnished, garnished and aired.

Everything's changed for the best -
how quivering and fierce we were,
there snowbound together,
simmering like wasps
in our tent of books!

Poor ghost, old love, speak
with your old voice
of flaming insight
that kept us awake all night.
In one bed and apart,

we heard the plow
groaning up hill -
a red light, then a blue,
as it tossed off the snow
to the side of the road.

But like love
the archers
are blind

Upon the green night,

leave traces of warm
lily.

The keel of the moon

and their quivers
fill with dew.

Ay, but like love
the archers
are blind!

Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly to-day,
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,
Live fairy-gifts fading away,
Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,
Let thy loveliness fade as it will,
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
Would entwine itself verdantly still.

It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,
That the fervor and faith of a soul may be known,
To which time will but make thee more dear!
No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,
But as truly loves on to the close,
As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
The same look which she turned when he rose!

    <Story nr="305" title="Aubade"> 

I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.
Till then I see what's really always there:
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,
Making all thought impossible but how
And where and when I shall myself die.
Arid interrogation: yet the dread
Of dying, and being dead,
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse
- The good not done, the love not given, time
Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because
An only life can take so long to climb
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;
But at the total emptiness for ever,
The sure extinction that we travel to
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,
Not to be anywhere,
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.

This is a special way of being afraid
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,
That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade
Created to pretend we never die,
And specious stuff that says No rational being
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing
That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,
Nothing to love or link with,
The anasthetic from which none come round.

And so it stays just on the edge of vision,
A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill
That slows each impulse down to indecision.
Most things may never happen: this one will,
And realisation of it rages out
In furnace-fear when we are caught without
People or drink. Courage is no good:
It means not scaring others. Being brave
Lets no one off the grave.
Death is no different whined at than withstood.

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,
Have always known, know that we can't escape,
Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.
Work has to be done.
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.      
    </Story>
    <Story nr="306" title="Patterns"> 

I walk down the garden-paths, 
And all the daffodils 
Are blowing, and the bright blue squills. 
I walk down the patterned garden-paths 
In my stiff, brocaded gown. 
With my powdered hair and jeweled fan, 
I too am a rare 
Pattern. As I wander down 
The garden-paths. 
My dress is richly figured, 
And the train 
Makes a pink and silver stain 
On the gravel, and the thrift 
Of the borders. 
Just a plate of current fashion, 
Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes. 
Not a softness anywhere about me, 
Only whalebone and brocade. 
And I sink on a seat in the shade 
Of a lime tree. For my passion 
Wars against the stiff brocade. 
The daffodils and squills 
Flutter in the breeze 
As they please. 
And I weep; 
For the lime-tree is in blossom 
And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom. 

And the plashing of waterdrops 
In the marble fountain 
Comes down the garden-paths. 
The dripping never stops. 
Underneath my stiffened gown 
Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin, 
A basin in the midst of hedges grown 
So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding, 
But she guesses he is near, 
And the sliding of the water 
Seems the stroking of a dear 
Hand upon her. 
What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown! 
I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground. 
All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground. 

I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths, 
And he would stumble after, 
Bewildered by my laughter. 
I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the 
buckles on his shoes. 
I would choose 
To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths, 
A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover. 
Till he caught me in the shade, 
And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he 
clasped me, 
Aching, melting, unafraid. 
With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops, 
And the plopping of the waterdrops, 
All about us in the open afternoon— 
I am very like to swoon 
With the weight of this brocade, 
For the sun sifts through the shade. 

Underneath the fallen blossom 
In my bosom, 
Is a letter I have hid. 
It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the 
Duke. 
"Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell 
Died in action Thursday se'nnight." 
As I read it in the white, morning sunlight, 
The letters squirmed like snakes. 
"Any answer, Madam," said my footman. 
"No," I told him. 
"See that the messenger takes some refreshment. 
No, no answer." 
And I walked into the garden, 
Up and down the patterned paths, 
In my stiff, correct brocade. 
The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun, 
Each one. 
I stood upright too, 
Held rigid to the pattern 
By the stiffness of my gown. 
Up and down I walked, 
Up and down. 

In a month he would have been my husband. 
In a month, here, underneath this lime, 
We would have broke the pattern; 
He for me, and I for him, 
He as Colonel, I as Lady, 
On this shady seat. 
He had a whim 
That sunlight carried blessing. 
And I answered, "It shall be as you have said." 
Now he is dead. 

In Summer and in Winter I shall walk 
Up and down 
The patterned garden-paths 
In my stiff, brocaded gown. 
The squills and daffodils 
Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow. 
I shall go 
Up and down 
In my gown. 
Gorgeously arrayed, 
Boned and stayed. 
And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace 
By each button, hook, and lace. 
For the man who should loose me is dead, 
Fighting with the Duke in Flanders, 
In a pattern called a war. 
Christ! What are patterns for?

    <Story nr="308" title="Little Boy Blue"> 

The little toy dog is covered with dust,
  But sturdy and stanch he stands;
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
  And his musket molds in his hands.
Time was when the little toy dog was new
  And the soldier was passing fair,
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue
  Kissed them and put them there.

"Now, don't you go till I come," he said,
  "And don't you make any noise!"
So toddling off to his trundle-bed
  He dreamed of the pretty toys.
And as he was dreaming, an angel song
  Awakened our Little Boy Blue,—
Oh, the years are many, the years are long,
  But the little toy friends are true.

Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,
  Each in the same old place,
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,
  The smile of a little face.
And they wonder, as waiting these long years through,
  In the dust of that little chair,
What has become of our Little Boy Blue
  Since he kissed them and put them there.From "The Poems of Eugene Field" 1911 Charles Scribner's Sons

    <Story nr="310" title="Sun and Shadow"> 

As I look from the isle, o'er its billows of green,
          To the billows of foam-crested blue,
          Yon bark, that afar in the distance is seen,
          Half dreaming, my eyes will pursue:
          Now dark in the shadow, she scatters the spray
          As the chaff in the stroke of the flail;
          Now white as the sea-gull, she flies on her way,
          The sun gleaming bright on her sail.

          Yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shun,—
          Of breakers that whiten and roar;
          How little he cares, if in shadow or sun
          They see him who gaze from the shore!
          He looks to the beacon that looms from the reef,
          To the rock that is under his lee,
          As he drifts on the blast, like a wind-wafted leaf,
          O'er the gulfs of the desolate sea.

          Thus drifting afar to the dim-vaulted caves
          Where life and its ventures are laid,
          The dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves
          May see us in sunshine or shade;
          Yet true to our course, though the shadows grow dark,
          We'll trim our broad sail as before,
          And stand by the rudder that governs the bark,
          Nor ask how we look from the shore!

    <Story nr="311" title="A Boy Named Sue"> 

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, "My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die." Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, "Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong."

Yeah, he said, "Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue."
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue.

    <Story nr="312" title="The Hope Of My Heart"> 

"Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus, quoesumus ne memineris, Domine."



I left, to earth, a little maiden fair,
 With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;
I prayed that God might have her in His care
            And sight.

Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song;
 (Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)
The path she showed was but the path of wrong
            And shame.

"Cast her not out!" I cry.  God's kind words come —
 "Her future is with Me, as was her past;
It shall be My good will to bring her home
            At last."
